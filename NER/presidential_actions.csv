This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.&nbsp; Invalidating the true and biological category of &#8220;woman&#8221; improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women&#8217;s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.&nbsp; Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy and Definitions. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. &nbsp;These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. &nbsp;Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a) &nbsp;&#8220;Sex&#8221; shall refer to an individual&#8217;s immutable biological classification as either male or female. &nbsp;&#8220;Sex&#8221; is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of &#8220;gender identity.&#8221; (b) &nbsp;&#8220;Women&#8221; or &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8221; or &#8220;girl&#8221; shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c) &nbsp;&#8220;Men&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;boys&#8221; or &#8220;boy&#8221; shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d) &nbsp;&#8220;Female&#8221; means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e) &nbsp;&#8220;Male&#8221; means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. (f) &nbsp;&#8220;Gender ideology&#8221; replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. &nbsp;Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g) &nbsp;&#8220;Gender identity&#8221; reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) &nbsp;Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. &nbsp;Each agency should therefore give the terms &#8220;sex&#8221;, &#8220;male&#8221;, &#8220;female&#8221;, &#8220;men&#8221;, &#8220;women&#8221;, &#8220;boys&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8221; the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) &nbsp;When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term &#8220;sex&#8221; and not &#8220;gender&#8221; in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) &nbsp;The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder&#8217;s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees&#8217; sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) &nbsp;Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. &nbsp;Agency forms that require an individual&#8217;s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.&nbsp; Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) &nbsp;The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act.&nbsp; This position is legally untenable and has harmed women.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities.&nbsp; In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) &nbsp;Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.&nbsp; Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Privacy in Intimate Spaces .&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women&#8217;s prisons or housed in women&#8217;s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled &#8220;Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual&#8217;s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs&#8221; of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate&#8217;s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) &nbsp;Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Protecting Rights. &nbsp;The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&nbsp; In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6.&nbsp; Bill Text. &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order.

News Administration Issues Contact Visit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 X Instagram Facebook WH.GOV Copyright Privacy",14379,"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government –  DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of “woman” improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a) “Sex” shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female. “Sex” is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of “gender identity.” (b) “Women” or “woman” and “girls” or “girl” shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c) “Men” or “man” and “boys” or “boy” shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d) “Female” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e) “Male” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. (f) “Gender ideology” replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex. Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g) “Gender identity” reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms “sex”, “male”, “female”, “men”, “women”, “boys” and “girls” the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term “sex” and not “gender” in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees’ sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces . (a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. (b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled “Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual’s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs” of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters. (c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6. Bill Text. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7. Agency Implementation and Reporting. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementation of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. That update shall address: (i) changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022. These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved. (c) Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General’s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. Such documents include, but are not limited to: (i) “The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality”; (ii) the Department of Education’s guidance documents including: (A) “2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation” (July 2024); (B) “U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students”; (C) “U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School” (June 21, 2023); (D) “Departamento de Educación de EE.UU.

Clayton County” (June 22, 2021); (J) “Education in a Pandemic: The Disparate Impacts of COVID-19 on America’s Students” (June 9, 2021); and (K) “Back-to-School Message for Transgender Students from the U.S. Depts of Justice, Education, and HHS” (Aug. 17, 2021); (iii) the Attorney General’s Memorandum of March 26, 2021 entitled “Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972″; and (iv) the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s “Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace” (April 29, 2024). Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

Gulf of America. (a) The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America. The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce. It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres. Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today. The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world. The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies. The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities. Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world. The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America. (b) As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the “Gulf of America” the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico. The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law. The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.

The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.

Deadly narcotics and other illicit materials have flowed across the border while agents and officers spend their limited resources processing illegal aliens for release into the United States. &nbsp;These catch-and-release policies undermine the rule of law and our sovereignty, create substantial risks to public safety and security, and divert critical resources away from stopping the entry of contraband and fugitives into the United States. &nbsp; We have limited information on the precise whereabouts of a great number of these illegal aliens who have entered the United States over the last 4 years. This cannot stand. &nbsp;A nation without borders is not a nation, and the Federal Government must act with urgency and strength to end the threats posed by an unsecured border. One of my most important obligations is to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement. My Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to stop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States. Sec. 2.&nbsp; Policy . &nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to take all appropriate action to secure the borders of our Nation through the following means: &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Establishing a physical wall and other barriers monitored and supported by adequate personnel and technology; (b) &nbsp;Deterring and preventing the entry of illegal aliens into the United States; (c)&nbsp; Detaining, to the maximum extent authorized by law, aliens apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, until such time as they are removed from the United States; (d) &nbsp;Removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of Federal law; (e)&nbsp; Pursuing criminal charges against illegal aliens who violate the immigration laws, and against those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States; (f) &nbsp;Cooperating fully with State and local law enforcement officials in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities; and (g) &nbsp;Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United States. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Physical Barriers. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to deploy and construct temporary and permanent physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Deployment of Personnel. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate and lawful action to deploy sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control; and (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to supplement available personnel to secure the southern border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States through the use of sections 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6)). Sec. 5. &nbsp;Detention. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions to detain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law until their successful removal from the United States. &nbsp;The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, issue new policy guidance or propose regulations regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as &#8220;catch-and-release,&#8221; whereby illegal aliens are routinely released into the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols. &nbsp;As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States and ensure that, pending removal proceedings, aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came. Sec. 7. &nbsp;Adjusting Parole Policies. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to: (a) &nbsp;Cease using the &#8220;CBP One&#8221; application as a method of paroling or facilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the United States; (b) &nbsp;Terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders, including the program known as the &#8220;Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.&#8221; (c) &nbsp;Align all policies and operations at the southern border of the United States to be consistent with the policy of Section 2 of this order and ensure that all future parole determinations fully comply with this order and with applicable law. Sec. 8. &nbsp;Additional International Cooperation. &nbsp;The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to facilitate additional international cooperation and agreements, consistent with the policy of Section 2, including entering into agreements based upon the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(A)) or any other applicable provision of law. Sec. 9. &nbsp;DNA and Identification Requirements. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to fulfill the requirements of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, title X of Public Law 109-162, for all aliens detained under the authority of the United States; and (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to use any available technologies and procedures to determine the validity of any claimed familial relationship between aliens encountered or apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 10. &nbsp;Prosecution of Offenses. &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of offenses that relate to the borders of the United States, including the investigation and prosecution of offenses that involve human smuggling, human trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking in the United States. Sec. 11.&nbsp; Additional Measures.&nbsp; Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide recommendations to the President regarding the use of any other authority to protect the United States from foreign threats and secure the southern border. Sec. 12. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

One of my most important obligations is to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement. My Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to stop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States. Sec. 2. Policy . It is the policy of the United States to take all appropriate action to secure the borders of our Nation through the following means: (a) Establishing a physical wall and other barriers monitored and supported by adequate personnel and technology; (b) Deterring and preventing the entry of illegal aliens into the United States; (c) Detaining, to the maximum extent authorized by law, aliens apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, until such time as they are removed from the United States; (d) Removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of Federal law; (e) Pursuing criminal charges against illegal aliens who violate the immigration laws, and against those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States; (f) Cooperating fully with State and local law enforcement officials in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities; and (g) Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United States. Sec. 3. Physical Barriers. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to deploy and construct temporary and permanent physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. Sec. 4. Deployment of Personnel. (a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate and lawful action to deploy sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control; and (b) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to supplement available personnel to secure the southern border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States through the use of sections 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6)). Sec. 5. Detention. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions to detain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law until their successful removal from the United States. The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, issue new policy guidance or propose regulations regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch-and-release,” whereby illegal aliens are routinely released into the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law. Sec. 6. Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols. As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States and ensure that, pending removal proceedings, aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came. Sec. 7. Adjusting Parole Policies. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to: (a) Cease using the “CBP One” application as a method of paroling or facilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the United States; (b) Terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders, including the program known as the “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.” (c) Align all policies and operations at the southern border of the United States to be consistent with the policy of Section 2 of this order and ensure that all future parole determinations fully comply with this order and with applicable law. Sec. 8. Additional International Cooperation. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to facilitate additional international cooperation and agreements, consistent with the policy of Section 2, including entering into agreements based upon the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(A)) or any other applicable provision of law. Sec. 9. DNA and Identification Requirements. (a) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to fulfill the requirements of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, title X of Public Law 109-162, for all aliens detained under the authority of the United States; and (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to use any available technologies and procedures to determine the validity of any claimed familial relationship between aliens encountered or apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 10. Prosecution of Offenses. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of offenses that relate to the borders of the United States, including the investigation and prosecution of offenses that involve human smuggling, human trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking in the United States. Sec. 11. Additional Measures. Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide recommendations to the President regarding the use of any other authority to protect the United States from foreign threats and secure the southern border. Sec. 12. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Yet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country. &nbsp;At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law. &nbsp;When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment. &nbsp;And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row: &nbsp;remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport. &nbsp;He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs. &nbsp;Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment.

SES officials have enormous influence over the functioning of the Federal Government, and thus the well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans. As the Constitution makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has reaffirmed, “the ‘executive Power’ — all of it — is ‘vested in a President,’ who must ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” Seila Law LLC v.

The President’s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President.

The United States Government&#8217;s decision-making structures and processes to address national security challenges must therefore be equally adaptive and comprehensive.&nbsp; They must be able to competently design and execute cooperative and integrated interagency solutions to address these problems, and protect and advance the national interests of the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, to advise and assist me in this endeavor, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring shall be organized as set forth in this Memorandum.&nbsp; This Memorandum prevails over any prior orders, directives, memoranda, or other Presidential guidance related to the organization of the National Security Council (NSC or Council). A. &nbsp;The National Security Council and Supporting Staff 1. &nbsp; Functions, Responsibilities, and Chairs. (a) &nbsp; Functions and Responsibilities.&nbsp; The National Security Act of 1947, as amended (the Act), established the NSC to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to national security.&nbsp; The Homeland Security Council (HSC) has the distinct purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security. &nbsp;The NSC shall convene as the HSC on topic areas agreed to in advance by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security (Homeland Security Advisor). &nbsp;Along with its subordinate committees and staff, the NSC shall be the President&#8217;s principal means for coordinating Executive departments and agencies in the development and implementation of national and homeland security policies, strategies, activities, and functions, their integration across departments and agencies within their purview, and for long-term strategic planning. (b)&nbsp; Chairs. &nbsp;The President will chair the NSC. &nbsp;When the President is absent from a meeting of the Council, he may appoint a Cabinet-level official to chair. 2.&nbsp; NSC Staffing Responsibilities of the National Security Advisor. (a) &nbsp;Role of the National Security Advisor.&nbsp; The National Security Advisor shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President&#8217;s direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording and communicating Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner. &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Role of the Homeland Security Advisor. &nbsp; When convened as the HSC, the duties referenced in subsection (2)(a) shall be the responsibility of the Homeland Security Advisor.&nbsp; 3. &nbsp; Designating NSC Members, Attendees, and Invitees. (a)&nbsp; Membership.&nbsp; The NSC membership consists of the statutory members set forth in section 101(c)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3021(c)(1)): The President; The Vice President; The Secretary of State; The Secretary of the Treasury; The Secretary of Defense; The Secretary of Energy; The Director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy; and additional members hereby designated by the President pursuant to section 101(c)(1) of the Act: The Attorney General; The Secretary of the Interior; Chief of Staff to the President (White House Chief of Staff); and The National Security Advisor. When the NSC convenes as the HSC, members shall also include: The Secretary of Homeland Security; and 13) The Homeland Security Advisor. (b)&nbsp; NSC Meeting Attendees. &nbsp; The National Security Advisor retains the discretion to determine the attendee list for all meetings of the NSC, including by requesting the attendance of any senior official of the Executive Branch. &nbsp;The Homeland Security Advisor retains this same discretion when the NSC convenes as the HSC. &nbsp;This discretion shall be exercised based on the policy relevance of attendees to the issues being considered, the need for secrecy on sensitive matters, staffing requirements, and other considerations. As regular practice, the National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor shall include as additional non-voting attendees: The Director of National Intelligence (non-voting advisor); The Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker) or, when convening as the HSC, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker); The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (non-voting advisor); and The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (non-voting advisor). (c) &nbsp; NSC Regular Invitees. &nbsp;Unless specifically restricted, these officials are invited to attend any NSC and HSC meeting as non-voting advisors: The Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President; The Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy; The Assistant to the President for Policy; and The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Counsel to the National Security Advisor. 4.&nbsp; Right to Propose Agenda Items. Any NSC member attending a meeting in a voting capacity may propose, in advance and in accordance with a timeline set by the National Security Advisor or his designee, agenda items for their consideration. [1] &nbsp;The National Security Advisor will determine whether to include these items on the agenda.&nbsp; The Homeland Security Advisor shall have this same discretion when the Council is convened as the HSC. 5.&nbsp; The National Security Council Staff. (a) &nbsp; Staff Fusion. &nbsp;There is a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) that serves both the NSC on national security matters and the HSC when the Council is considering homeland security matters.&nbsp; The staff is headed by a single Executive Secretary, in accordance with section 101(e)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021(e)(1)) and section 905 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 495). (b) &nbsp; Purpose. &nbsp;The purposes of the National Security Advisor and subordinate staff are to (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise and assist the President in the course of conducting activities that relate to or affect the carrying out of the President&#8217;s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties pertaining to national or homeland security, pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, as amended; [2] (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;advise and assist the other members of the NSC (and the NSC when convening as the HSC), and others in the White House; (iii) &nbsp;help the President plan and set priorities, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;advise and make recommendations to the President with respect to, and establish, integrated domestic, foreign, and military policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and functions of the Government relating to national and homeland security, pursuant to sections 2 and 101(b)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3002, 3021(b)(1)); (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinate, facilitate, monitor, oversee, and review Administration policies and their implementation with respect to national security, and make resulting recommendations to the President; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;help the President resolve major conflicts among departments and agencies with regard to national security, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. (c) &nbsp; Fair, Balanced, and Thorough Processes. &nbsp;In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, the NSC staff shall ensure that the processes it organizes, coordinates, and manages fairly and thoroughly gather the facts, intelligence, and other relevant information necessary to NSC decisions; fully analyze the issues; consider a full range of views and options; assess the prospects, risks, costs, and implications of each option; and distill these options for the President, other NSC principals, and senior officials participating in the subsidiary committees of the NSC or HSC, in a fair, balanced, and organized way. &nbsp;The National Security Advisor and subordinate NSC staff shall represent the views and differences of NSC principals and other senior officials to the President with accuracy and fidelity. (d) &nbsp; Policy Development. &nbsp;In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, [8] the NSC staff shall facilitate the development and refinement of interagency policy options, and develop additional options besides those proposed by departments and agencies as necessary, both to complement, supplement, and enhance their work, and to offer the President and other NSC principals and other senior officials a sufficiently broad menu of operationally feasible options for consideration, deliberation, and decision. B. &nbsp;The Principals Committee 1.&nbsp; Principals Committee Establishment. (a) &nbsp;(i) &nbsp; Functions and Responsibilities. &nbsp;The Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. &nbsp;The PC shall develop options and recommendations for the President on national security and homeland security matters requiring the President&#8217;s attention, and with the Committee&#8217;s full consensus shall set priorities, issue policy guidance, and facilitate coordination and integration on national security policy and implementation issues as appropriate that do not require Presidential attention. [9] &nbsp;Issues involving matters that are statutorily authorized for decision by a principal, or delegated to a principal by the President, can be coordinated and decided by the principals without requiring Presidential attention. (ii) &nbsp; Voting and NSC Referral. &nbsp; Consensus is reached when all voting (i.e., non-advisory) attendees present either vote affirmatively for the same decisional option or formally abstain, and all such votes shall be recorded and minuted. &nbsp;Issues for which the Committee fails to reach consensus shall be referred to the NSC for decision, with a formal nonconcurrence required by at least one non-advisory attendee present for such a referral. &nbsp;Whether an issue requires Presidential attention, and the Committee attendees&#8217; positions on the issue itself, shall be separately polled. &nbsp;If a voting attendee does not concur with the determination that Presidential consideration is not required, the issue shall be referred, along with the results of the PC&#8217;s deliberation on the issue itself and its recommendations, to deliberation by the NSC. (b) &nbsp; Role of the National Security Advisor. &nbsp;The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor. &nbsp;The Chair shall determine the agenda, location, and meeting materials, in consultation with the appropriate attendees. (c) &nbsp; Substitute Chairs. &nbsp;At his sole discretion, the National Security Advisor may delegate authority to convene and chair or co-chair the PC to an appropriate attendee of the NSC or EOP policy council senior official.&nbsp; The Homeland Security Advisor, who is Chair when the PC considers matters that would be raised to the NSC convening as the HSC, may similarly delegate such duties. (d) &nbsp; Right to Propose Agenda Items. &nbsp; Any PC member attending in a voting capacity may propose, in advance and in accordance with a timeline set by the Chair, agenda items for consideration by the PC. &nbsp;The Chair will determine which, if any, shall be included. 2. &nbsp; Executive Secretary Responsibilities and Process.

The national and homeland security threats facing the United States are complex and rapidly evolving. These issues often do not fit neatly into the categories that single departments and agencies are designed to optimally address, a fact recognized and exploited by our strategic competitors and adversaries in their adoption of whole-of-government and even whole-of-society approaches. The United States Government’s decision-making structures and processes to address national security challenges must therefore be equally adaptive and comprehensive. They must be able to competently design and execute cooperative and integrated interagency solutions to address these problems, and protect and advance the national interests of the United States. Therefore, to advise and assist me in this endeavor, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring shall be organized as set forth in this Memorandum. This Memorandum prevails over any prior orders, directives, memoranda, or other Presidential guidance related to the organization of the National Security Council (NSC or Council). A. The National Security Council and Supporting Staff 1. Functions, Responsibilities, and Chairs. (a) Functions and Responsibilities. The National Security Act of 1947, as amended (the Act), established the NSC to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to national security. The Homeland Security Council (HSC) has the distinct purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security. The NSC shall convene as the HSC on topic areas agreed to in advance by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security (Homeland Security Advisor). Along with its subordinate committees and staff, the NSC shall be the President’s principal means for coordinating Executive departments and agencies in the development and implementation of national and homeland security policies, strategies, activities, and functions, their integration across departments and agencies within their purview, and for long-term strategic planning. (b) Chairs. The President will chair the NSC. When the President is absent from a meeting of the Council, he may appoint a Cabinet-level official to chair. 2. NSC Staffing Responsibilities of the National Security Advisor. (a) Role of the National Security Advisor. The National Security Advisor shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President’s direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording and communicating Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner. (b) Role of the Homeland Security Advisor. When convened as the HSC, the duties referenced in subsection (2)(a) shall be the responsibility of the Homeland Security Advisor. 3. Designating NSC Members, Attendees, and Invitees. (a) Membership. The NSC membership consists of the statutory members set forth in section 101(c)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3021(c)(1)): The President; The Vice President; The Secretary of State; The Secretary of the Treasury; The Secretary of Defense; The Secretary of Energy; The Director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy; and additional members hereby designated by the President pursuant to section 101(c)(1) of the Act: The Attorney General; The Secretary of the Interior; Chief of Staff to the President (White House Chief of Staff); and The National Security Advisor. When the NSC convenes as the HSC, members shall also include: The Secretary of Homeland Security; and 13) The Homeland Security Advisor. (b) NSC Meeting Attendees. The National Security Advisor retains the discretion to determine the attendee list for all meetings of the NSC, including by requesting the attendance of any senior official of the Executive Branch. The Homeland Security Advisor retains this same discretion when the NSC convenes as the HSC. This discretion shall be exercised based on the policy relevance of attendees to the issues being considered, the need for secrecy on sensitive matters, staffing requirements, and other considerations. As regular practice, the National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor shall include as additional non-voting attendees: The Director of National Intelligence (non-voting advisor); The Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker) or, when convening as the HSC, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (non-voting advisor and principal notetaker); The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (non-voting advisor); and The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (non-voting advisor). (c) NSC Regular Invitees. Unless specifically restricted, these officials are invited to attend any NSC and HSC meeting as non-voting advisors: The Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President; The Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy; The Assistant to the President for Policy; and The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Counsel to the National Security Advisor. 4. Right to Propose Agenda Items. Any NSC member attending a meeting in a voting capacity may propose, in advance and in accordance with a timeline set by the National Security Advisor or his designee, agenda items for their consideration. [1] The National Security Advisor will determine whether to include these items on the agenda. The Homeland Security Advisor shall have this same discretion when the Council is convened as the HSC. 5. The National Security Council Staff. (a) Staff Fusion. There is a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) that serves both the NSC on national security matters and the HSC when the Council is considering homeland security matters. The staff is headed by a single Executive Secretary, in accordance with section 101(e)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021(e)(1)) and section 905 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 495). (b) Purpose. The purposes of the National Security Advisor and subordinate staff are to (i) advise and assist the President in the course of conducting activities that relate to or affect the carrying out of the President’s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties pertaining to national or homeland security, pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, as amended; [2] (ii) advise and assist the other members of the NSC (and the NSC when convening as the HSC), and others in the White House; (iii) help the President plan and set priorities, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977; (iv) advise and make recommendations to the President with respect to, and establish, integrated domestic, foreign, and military policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and functions of the Government relating to national and homeland security, pursuant to sections 2 and 101(b)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 3002, 3021(b)(1)); (v) coordinate, facilitate, monitor, oversee, and review Administration policies and their implementation with respect to national security, and make resulting recommendations to the President; (vi) help the President resolve major conflicts among departments and agencies with regard to national security, in accordance with section II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. (c) Fair, Balanced, and Thorough Processes. In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, the NSC staff shall ensure that the processes it organizes, coordinates, and manages fairly and thoroughly gather the facts, intelligence, and other relevant information necessary to NSC decisions; fully analyze the issues; consider a full range of views and options; assess the prospects, risks, costs, and implications of each option; and distill these options for the President, other NSC principals, and senior officials participating in the subsidiary committees of the NSC or HSC, in a fair, balanced, and organized way. The National Security Advisor and subordinate NSC staff shall represent the views and differences of NSC principals and other senior officials to the President with accuracy and fidelity. (d) Policy Development. In accordance with sections I and II of the Message of the President in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, [8] the NSC staff shall facilitate the development and refinement of interagency policy options, and develop additional options besides those proposed by departments and agencies as necessary, both to complement, supplement, and enhance their work, and to offer the President and other NSC principals and other senior officials a sufficiently broad menu of operationally feasible options for consideration, deliberation, and decision. B. The Principals Committee 1. Principals Committee Establishment. (a) (i) Functions and Responsibilities. The Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. The PC shall develop options and recommendations for the President on national security and homeland security matters requiring the President’s attention, and with the Committee’s full consensus shall set priorities, issue policy guidance, and facilitate coordination and integration on national security policy and implementation issues as appropriate that do not require Presidential attention. [9] Issues involving matters that are statutorily authorized for decision by a principal, or delegated to a principal by the President, can be coordinated and decided by the principals without requiring Presidential attention. (ii) Voting and NSC Referral. Consensus is reached when all voting (i.e., non-advisory) attendees present either vote affirmatively for the same decisional option or formally abstain, and all such votes shall be recorded and minuted. Issues for which the Committee fails to reach consensus shall be referred to the NSC for decision, with a formal nonconcurrence required by at least one non-advisory attendee present for such a referral. Whether an issue requires Presidential attention, and the Committee attendees’ positions on the issue itself, shall be separately polled. If a voting attendee does not concur with the determination that Presidential consideration is not required, the issue shall be referred, along with the results of the PC’s deliberation on the issue itself and its recommendations, to deliberation by the NSC. (b) Role of the National Security Advisor. The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor. The Chair shall determine the agenda, location, and meeting materials, in consultation with the appropriate attendees. (c) Substitute Chairs. At his sole discretion, the National Security Advisor may delegate authority to convene and chair or co-chair the PC to an appropriate attendee of the NSC or EOP policy council senior official. The Homeland Security Advisor, who is Chair when the PC considers matters that would be raised to the NSC convening as the HSC, may similarly delegate such duties. (d) Right to Propose Agenda Items.

[10] The Executive Secretary shall generally be assisted in these tasks by the senior directors and other NSC staff by the senior directors and other NSC staff. (b) Dispute Resolution Process. If a PC voting attendee disputes that the conclusions or decisions of the PC were correctly minuted, this must be communicated in writing to the Executive Secretary and the National Security Advisor (and any substitute Chair if appropriate) within three business days, although those officials may allow additional time if exigent or extenuating circumstances require it. If resolution of the dispute cannot be achieved, and any necessary amended report of the PC proceedings was issued within a week of the dispute being communicated, the disputing attendee may appeal the matter to the White House Chief of Staff or, should that official so designate, to the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, whose decision shall be final. 3.

This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.&nbsp; It has led to the horrific and inexcusable murders of many innocent American citizens, including women and children, at the hands of illegal aliens. &nbsp;Foreign criminal gangs and cartels have begun seizing control of parts of cities, attacking our most vulnerable citizens, and terrorizing Americans beyond the control of local law enforcement.&nbsp; Cartels control vast territories just south of our southern border, effectively controlling who can and cannot travel to the United States from Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have tragically died from drug overdoses because of the illicit narcotics that have flowed across the southern border. This assault on the American people and the integrity of America&#8217;s sovereign borders represents a grave threat to our Nation. Because of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border. To protect the security and safety of United States citizens, to protect each of the States against invasion, and to uphold my duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it is my responsibility as President to ensure that the illegal entry of aliens into the United States via the southern border be immediately and entirely stopped. As Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn duty than to protect the American people. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Sec. 2. &nbsp;Additional Physical Barriers. &nbsp;The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall immediately take all appropriate action, consistent with law, including 10 U.S.C. 2214, to construct additional physical barriers along the southern border. &nbsp;To the extent possible, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall coordinate with any Governor of a State that is willing to assist with the deployment of any physical infrastructure to improve operational security at the southern border. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Unmanned Aerial Systems. &nbsp;The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission shall, consistent with applicable law, consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Revision of Policies and Strategies. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to prioritize the impedance and denial of the unauthorized physical entry of aliens across the southern border of the United States, and to ensure that use of force policies prioritize the safety and security of Department of Homeland Security personnel and of members of the Armed Forces.

It is thus in the national interest to unleash America&#8217;s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. &nbsp;This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. &nbsp;It will also rebuild our Nation&#8217;s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp; It is the policy of the United States: (a) &nbsp;to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) &nbsp;to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) &nbsp;to protect the United States&#8217;s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) &nbsp;to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) &nbsp;to eliminate the &#8220;electric vehicle (EV) mandate&#8221; and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;to safeguard the American people&#8217;s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) &nbsp;to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) &nbsp;to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and (i) &nbsp;to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 3. &nbsp;Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources &#8212; with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources &#8212; or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. &nbsp;The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) &nbsp;Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii)&nbsp; request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) &nbsp;Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); (iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad); (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology); (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office); (vii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk); (viii) &nbsp;Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); (ix) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); (x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation&#8217;s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies); (xi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and (xii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation&#8217;s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). (b) &nbsp;All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately.&nbsp; Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the &#8220;American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding&#8221; dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities.&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law.&nbsp; Sec. 5. &nbsp;Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) &nbsp;To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42&nbsp;U.S.C. 4321 et seq. , and propose rescinding CEQ&#8217;s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) &nbsp;Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5). &nbsp;Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) &nbsp; The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule. &nbsp;For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation&#8217;s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits. &nbsp;Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) &nbsp;The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) &nbsp;provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. &nbsp;In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including:&nbsp; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking);&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System);&nbsp; (iii) &nbsp;the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG&#8217;s work or guidance. (c) &nbsp;The calculation of the &#8220;social cost of carbon&#8221; is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. &nbsp;Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. &nbsp;Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the &#8220;social cost of carbon&#8221; calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision. (d) &nbsp;Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis). (e) &nbsp;Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis. (f) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator&#8217;s findings, &#8220;Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,&#8221; Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. &nbsp;Terminating the Green New Deal. &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. &nbsp;Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. &nbsp;No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) &nbsp;When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. &nbsp;The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) &nbsp;All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. &nbsp; Protecting America&#8217;s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. &nbsp;In assessing the &#8220;Public Interest&#8221; to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) &nbsp;With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. , the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences). &nbsp;In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. &nbsp;MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President. (c)&nbsp; Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license. (d)&nbsp; If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. &nbsp;Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. &nbsp; Restoring America&#8217;s Mineral Dominance .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) &nbsp;The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey&#8217;s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) &nbsp;The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) &nbsp;The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implications of the Nation&#8217;s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations. (k) &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Sec. 10. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: (a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) to protect the United States’s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; (f) to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and (i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. Sec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources — or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions . (a) The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished: (i) Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); (ii) Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); (iii) Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad); (iv) Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology); (v) Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); (vi) Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office); (vii) Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk); (viii) Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); (ix) Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); (x) Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies); (xi) Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and (xii) Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). (b) All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately. Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the “American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding” dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing. (c) Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law. (d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. (e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. Sec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. , and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule. For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation’s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits. Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: (i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking); (ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System); (iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG’s work or guidance. (c) The calculation of the “social cost of carbon” is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the “social cost of carbon” calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision. (d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis). (e) Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis. (f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. Protecting America’s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the “Public Interest” to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. , the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President. (c) Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license. (d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. Restoring America’s Mineral Dominance . (a) The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations. (k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Sec. 10. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

pa_016,REALIGNING THE UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM,EXECUTIVE ORDER,2025-01-20,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/,"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions REALIGNING THE UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 REALIGNING THE United States REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. , and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). &nbsp;Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants.&nbsp; Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals. &nbsp;Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration. The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees. &nbsp;This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens. &nbsp;It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. &nbsp;I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended &#8212; subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section &#8212; until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.&nbsp; This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 am eastern standard time on January 27, 2025.

Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants. Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals. Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration. The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees. This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens. It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. Sec. 3. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. (a) I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended — subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section — until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order. This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 am eastern standard time on January 27, 2025. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order. (c) Notwithstanding the suspension of the USRAP imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit aliens to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such aliens as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. (d) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement. In all cases, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that the State and local consultation requirements in 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) are carried out with respect to all refugees admitted to the United States. Sec. 4. Resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Within 90 days of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States, in light of the policies outlined in section 2 of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until I determine that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States. Sec. 5. Revocation. Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs To Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration), is hereby revoked. Sec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 7. General Provisions.

Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications. &nbsp;Section 2(g) of the Act defines &#8220;Foreign Adversary Controlled Application&#8221; to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok. &nbsp;Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025. I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions. &nbsp;To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advisors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. &nbsp;My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date. The unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act &#8212; one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States &#8212; interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act&#8217;s prohibitions before they take effect. &nbsp;This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns. &nbsp;Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Action . &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. &nbsp;During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. &nbsp;In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the signing of this order. (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a). (c) &nbsp;I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order. (d)&nbsp; Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive&#8217;s exclusive authority to enforce the Act.

(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

RESTORING MERIT-BASED OPPORTUNITY",OTHER,2025-01-21,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/,"Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ENDING ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND RESTORING MERIT-BASED OPPORTUNITY January 21, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose. Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans. Yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; (DEI) or &#8220;diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility&#8221; (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation. Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. These illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing. The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work. I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. Sec. 3. Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government. (a) The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations); (ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce); (iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and (iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce). (b) The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws. Accordingly: (i) Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked. For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025. (ii) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease: (A) Promoting &#8220;diversity&#8221;; (B) Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;; and (C) Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin. (iii) In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation&#8217;s civil rights laws. (iv) The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award: (A) A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government&#8217;s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and (B) A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. (c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall: (i) Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance; (ii) Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and (iii) Terminate all &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;equity,&#8221; &#8220;equitable decision-making,&#8221; &#8220;equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,&#8221; &#8220;advancing equity,&#8221; and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate. Sec. 4. Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences. (a) The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order. (b) To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI. The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying: (i) Key sectors of concern within each agency&#8217;s jurisdiction; (ii) The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern; (iii) A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated &#8220;DEI&#8221; or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars; (iv) Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws; (v) Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and (vi) Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance. Sec. 5. Other Actions. Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Sec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 7. Scope. (a) This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq. (b) This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech. (c) This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

At the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth. &nbsp;But this foundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method. &nbsp;These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America&#8217;s competitive edge. This order establishes the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Establishment. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). (b) &nbsp;The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members. &nbsp;The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special Advisor for AI &amp; Crypto shall be members of the PCAST. &nbsp;If also serving as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the APST may designate the U.S. Chief Technology Officer as a member. &nbsp;The remaining members shall be distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President. &nbsp;These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and innovation. (c) &nbsp;The APST and the Special Advisor for AI &amp; Crypto shall serve as Co-Chairs of the PCAST. &nbsp;The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Functions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The PCAST shall advise the President on matters involving science, technology, education, and innovation policy. &nbsp;The Council shall also provide the President with scientific and technical information that is needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics. (b) &nbsp;The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for information, analysis, evaluation, or advice; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community; the private sector; universities; national laboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit organizations; (iii) &nbsp;serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as amended (15 U.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the President&#8217;s Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law 108-153), as amended (15 U.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. (c) &nbsp;The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests from the NSTC. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Administration. &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information concerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the PCAST Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the PCAST&#8217;s functions. (b) &nbsp;In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups, to assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information directly to the PCAST. (c) &nbsp;In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis regarding classified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of the PCAST, its standing subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold a current clearance for access to classified information receive security clearance and access determinations pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to Classified Information), as amended, or any successor order. (d) &nbsp;The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the PCAST may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations. (e) &nbsp;Members of the PCAST shall serve without any compensation for their work on the PCAST, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707). (f) &nbsp;Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Termination. &nbsp;The PCAST shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President.

(b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy . On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense mandated that all service members receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The Secretary of Defense later rescinded the mandate on January 10, 2023. The vaccine mandate was an unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden on our service members.

Purpose. The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States. President Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized. And since the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development of limited homeland missile defense, official United States homeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches. Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities. Sec. 2. Policy. To further the goal of peace through strength, it is the policy of the United States that: (a) The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield; (b) The United States will deter &#8212; and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against &#8212; any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland; and (c) The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability. Sec . 3. Implementation. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall: (a) Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield. The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for: (i) Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries; (ii) Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer; (iii) Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept; (iv) Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack; (v) Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture; (vi) Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase; (vii) Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features; and (viii) Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks; (b) Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of Defense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to implement this directive; (c) Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and (d) In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United States Northern Command, submit to the President: (i) An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and (ii) A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries. Sec. 4. Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review. The United States continues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops. Following the submission to the President of the next-generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can: (a) Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations; (b) Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States troops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and (c) Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Policy and Purpose . Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child&#8217;s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions. This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation&#8217;s history, and it must end. Countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding. &nbsp;Moreover, these vulnerable youths&#8217; medical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called &#8220;transition&#8221; of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) &nbsp;The term &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;children&#8221; means an individual or individuals under 19 years of age. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;pediatric&#8221; means relating to the medical care of a child. (c) The phrase &#8220;chemical and surgical mutilation&#8221; means the use of puberty blockers, including GnRH agonists and other interventions, to delay the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in an individual who does not identify as his or her sex; the use of sex hormones, such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, to align an individual&#8217;s physical appearance with an identity that differs from his or her sex; and surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual&#8217;s physical appearance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt to alter or remove an individual&#8217;s sexual organs to minimize or destroy their natural biological functions. This phrase sometimes is referred to as &#8220;gender affirming care.&#8221; Sec. 3. Ending Reliance on Junk Science. (a) The blatant harm done to children by chemical and surgical mutilation cloaks itself in medical necessity, spurred by guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which lacks scientific integrity. In light of the scientific concerns with the WPATH guidance: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;agencies shall rescind or amend all policies that rely on WPATH guidance, including WPATH&#8217;s &#8220;Standards of Care Version 8&#8221;; and&nbsp; (ii) within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall publish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation. Sec. 4. Defunding Chemical and Surgical Mutilation . The head of each executive department or agency (agency) that provides research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, shall, consistent with applicable law and in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children. Sec. 5. Additional Directives to the Secretary of HHS. (a) The Secretary of HHS shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children, including regulatory and sub-regulatory actions, which may involve the following laws, programs, issues, or documents: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;clinical-abuse or inappropriate-use assessments relevant to State Medicaid programs; (iii) &nbsp;mandatory drug use reviews; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality, safety, and oversight memoranda; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;essential health benefits requirements; and (vii) the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and other federally funded manuals, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. (b) The Secretary of HHS shall promptly withdraw HHS&#8217;s March 2, 2022, guidance document titled &#8220;HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy&#8221; and, in consultation with the Attorney General, issue new guidance protecting whistleblowers who take action related to ensuring compliance with this order. Sec. 6. TRICARE . The Department of Defense provides health insurance, through TRICARE, to nearly 2 million individuals under the age of 18. As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall commence a rulemaking or sub-regulatory action to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children from TRICARE coverage and amend the TRICARE provider handbook to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children. Sec. 7. Requirements for Insurance Carriers. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall: (a) include provisions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) programs call letter for the 2026 Plan Year specifying that eligible carriers, including the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, will exclude coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries or hormone treatments; and (b) &nbsp;negotiate to obtain appropriate corresponding reductions in FEHB and PSHB premiums. Sec. 8. Directives to the Department of Justice . The Attorney General shall: (a) review Department of Justice enforcement of section 116 of title 18, United States Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation; (b) convene States&#8217; Attorneys General and other law enforcement officers to coordinate the enforcement of laws against female genital mutilation across all American States and Territories; (c) prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation; (d) &nbsp;in consultation with the Congress, work to draft, propose, and promote legislation to enact a private right of action for children and the parents of children whose healthy body parts have been damaged by medical professionals practicing chemical and surgical mutilation, which should include a lengthy statute of limitations; and (e) prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end child-abusive practices by so-called sanctuary States that facilitate stripping custody from parents who support the healthy development of their own children, including by considering the application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and recognized constitutional rights. Sec. 9. Enforcing Adequate Progress. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order shall submit a single, combined report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, detailing progress in implementing this order and a timeline for future action. The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order (or their designees) to coordinate and prepare for this submission. Sec. 10. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy. Parents trust America&#8217;s schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand. In recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight. Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity. Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation&#8217;s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). Similarly, demanding acquiescence to &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; or &#8220;unconscious bias,&#8221; actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity. My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h. Sec. 2. Definitions. As used herein: (a) The definitions in the Executive Order &#8220;Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government&#8221; (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order. (b) &#8220;Discriminatory equity ideology&#8221; means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: (i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; (ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (iii) An individual&#8217;s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin; (iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; (v) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; (vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; (vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or (viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory. (c) &#8220;Educational service agency&#8221; (ESA) has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1401(5), and the terms &#8220;elementary school,&#8221; &#8220;local educational agency&#8221; (LEA), &#8220;secondary school,&#8221; and &#8220;state educational agency&#8221; (SEA) have the meanings given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (d) &#8220;Patriotic education&#8221; means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: (i) an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America&#8217;s founding and foundational principles; (ii) a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; (iii) the concept that commitment to America&#8217;s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and (iv) the concept that celebration of America&#8217;s greatness and history is proper. (e) &#8220;Social transition&#8221; means the process of adopting a &#8220;gender identity&#8221; or &#8220;gender marker&#8221; that differs from a person&#8217;s sex. This process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person&#8217;s name (e.g., &#8220;Jane&#8221; to &#8220;James&#8221;) or pronouns (e.g., &#8220;him&#8221; to &#8220;her&#8221;); calling a child &#8220;nonbinary&#8221;; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex. &#8220;Social transition&#8221; does not include chemical or surgical mutilation.

Purpose and Policy. Parents trust America’s schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand. In recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight. Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity. Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation’s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). Similarly, demanding acquiescence to “White Privilege” or “unconscious bias,” actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity. My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h. Sec. 2. Definitions. As used herein: (a) The definitions in the Executive Order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order. (b) “Discriminatory equity ideology” means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: (i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; (ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (iii) An individual’s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin; (iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; (v) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; (vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; (vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or (viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory. (c) “Educational service agency” (ESA) has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1401(5), and the terms “elementary school,” “local educational agency” (LEA), “secondary school,” and “state educational agency” (SEA) have the meanings given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (d) “Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: (i) an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles; (ii) a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; (iii) the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and (iv) the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is proper. (e) “Social transition” means the process of adopting a “gender identity” or “gender marker” that differs from a person’s sex. This process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person’s name (e.g., “Jane” to “James”) or pronouns (e.g., “him” to “her”); calling a child “nonbinary”; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex. “Social transition” does not include chemical or surgical mutilation. Sec. 3. Ending Indoctrination Strategy. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, to advise the President in formulating future policy, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall provide an Ending Indoctrination Strategy to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, containing recommendations and a plan for: (i) eliminating Federal funding or support for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology; and (ii) protecting parental rights, pursuant to FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h, with respect to any K-12 policies or conduct implicated by the purpose and policy of this order. (b) The Ending Indoctrination Strategy submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall contain a summary and analysis of the following: (i) All Federal funding sources and streams, including grants or contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology: (A) in K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B) in K-12 teacher education, certification, licensing, employment, or training; (ii) Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology in: (A) K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B) K-12 teacher certification, licensing, employment, or training; (iii) Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the social transition of a minor student, including through school staff or teachers or through deliberately concealing the minor’s social transition from the minor’s parents. (iv) Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize: (A) interference with a parent’s Federal statutory right to information regarding school curriculum, records, physical examinations, surveys, and other matters under the PPRA or FERPA; or (B) a violation of Title VI or Title IX; and (v) A summary and analysis of all relevant agency enforcement tools to advance the policies of this order. (c) The Attorney General shall coordinate with State attorneys general and local district attorneys in their efforts to enforce the law and file appropriate actions against K-12 teachers and school officials who violate the law by: (i) sexually exploiting minors; (ii) unlawfully practicing medicine by offering diagnoses and treatment without the requisite license; or (iii) otherwise unlawfully facilitating the social transition of a minor student.

Purpose. My Administration has fought and will continue to fight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world. On December 11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation&#8217;s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected. The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government. This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel. These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses. Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault. A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans&#8217; Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government&#8217;s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students &#8220;astounding.&#8221; This failure is unacceptable and ends today. Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence. Sec. 3. Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism. (b) The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention. (c) The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism. (d) The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism &#8212; pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 &#8212; within the Department&#8217;s Office for Civil Rights. (e) In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose. The ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness. Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance. It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America&#8217;s economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen. To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination. This practice is to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources, and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Sec. 3. Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025. (a) Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least 10 existing regulations to be repealed. (b) &nbsp;For fiscal year 2025, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), unless otherwise required by law or instructions from the Director. (c) &nbsp;In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of&nbsp;this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least 10&nbsp;prior regulations. (d) &nbsp;The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section. &nbsp;Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section. &nbsp;The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements. Sec. 4. Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter: (a) &nbsp;The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency&#8217;s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. (b) &nbsp;Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. &nbsp;Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director. &nbsp;To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan. (c) &nbsp;Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director. (d) &nbsp;During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025. &nbsp;No regulations exceeding the agency&#8217;s total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director. &nbsp;The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost. (e) &nbsp;The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section. Sec. 5. Definition. For purposes of this order, the term &#8220;regulation&#8221; or &#8220;rule&#8221; means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, including, without limitation, regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements, regardless of whether the same were enacted through the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act, but does not include: (a) &nbsp;regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States; (b) &nbsp;regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or (c) &nbsp;any other specific regulation or category of regulations exempted by the Director, who shall exempt those regulations or categories of regulations that impose minimal costs or burdens on the private sector or that are requested to be exempted by the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff or the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. Sec. 6. Implementation. (a) The Director is charged with implementing this order, including by providing agencies with updated guidance on implementing the ten-for-one rule described in section 3(a) of this order, including processes for identifying regulations for elimination, determining what constitutes, generally and specifically, a &#8220;rule&#8221; or &#8220;regulation&#8221; for purposes of this order, estimating and standardizing regulatory costs, and ensuring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws. (b) &nbsp;The Director shall revoke OMB Circular No. A-4 of November 9, 2023 (Regulatory Analysis), and all accompanying appendices, guidelines, and documents, and shall reinstate the prior version of Circular A-4, issued on September 17, 2003; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director shall reinstate the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget of April&nbsp;11, 2018, regarding review of tax regulations under Executive Order 12866. Sec. 7. Severability.

Purpose. The ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness. Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance. It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen. To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination. This practice is to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources, and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Sec. 3. Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025. (a) Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least 10 existing regulations to be repealed. (b) For fiscal year 2025, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), unless otherwise required by law or instructions from the Director. (c) In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least 10 prior regulations. (d) The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section. Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section. The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements. Sec. 4. Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter: (a) The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency’s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. (b) Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director. To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan. (c) Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director. (d) During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025. No regulations exceeding the agency’s total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director. The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost. (e) The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section. Sec. 5. Definition. For purposes of this order, the term “regulation” or “rule” means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, including, without limitation, regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements, regardless of whether the same were enacted through the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act, but does not include: (a) regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States; (b) regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or (c) any other specific regulation or category of regulations exempted by the Director, who shall exempt those regulations or categories of regulations that impose minimal costs or burdens on the private sector or that are requested to be exempted by the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff or the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. Sec. 6. Implementation. (a) The Director is charged with implementing this order, including by providing agencies with updated guidance on implementing the ten-for-one rule described in section 3(a) of this order, including processes for identifying regulations for elimination, determining what constitutes, generally and specifically, a “rule” or “regulation” for purposes of this order, estimating and standardizing regulatory costs, and ensuring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws. (b) The Director shall revoke OMB Circular No. A-4 of November 9, 2023 (Regulatory Analysis), and all accompanying appendices, guidelines, and documents, and shall reinstate the prior version of Circular A-4, issued on September 17, 2003; and (c) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director shall reinstate the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget of April 11, 2018, regarding review of tax regulations under Executive Order 12866. Sec. 7. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1601 et seq .) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section&nbsp;301 of&nbsp;title&nbsp;3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, and communities. This challenge threatens the fabric of our society. Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities. Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs. Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world&#8217;s leading producers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States.&nbsp; These DTOs often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, and overland corridors.&nbsp; The challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public consciousness, but our northern border is not exempt from these issues.&nbsp; Criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border.&nbsp; There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada.&nbsp; The flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the United States through both illicit distribution networks and international mail &#8212; due, in the case of the latter, to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes, also known as de minimis , under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code &#8212; has created a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).&nbsp; With respect to smuggling of illicit drugs across our northern border, Canada&#8217;s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids, which recognized Canada&#8217;s heightened domestic production of fentanyl, largely from British Columbia, and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution.&nbsp; Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown.&nbsp; And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security seized, comparatively, much less fentanyl from Canada than from Mexico last year, fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and destruction to America families.&nbsp; In fact, the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 9.5 million Americans. Immediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of Canada is assured. I hereby determine and order: Section 1. (a) As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A Nation without borders is not a nation at all. I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore. I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border). Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that Proclamation to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs. In addition, this failure to act on the part of Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat. This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada set forth in this order. In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat. Sec. 2. (a) All articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice described in subsection (e) of this section ( Federal Register notice), and except for those products described in subsection (b) of this section, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty. Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice. (b)&nbsp; With respect to energy or energy resources, as defined in section 8 of Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), and as otherwise included in the Federal Register notice, such articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty.&nbsp; Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action. (e)&nbsp; In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of Canada, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal Register .&nbsp; The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. (f)&nbsp; Articles that are products of Canada, except those that are eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.&nbsp; Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone .&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.&nbsp; (h)&nbsp; For avoidance of doubt, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance related to trade with Canada that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (j)&nbsp; The articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b). Sec. 3. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation at our northern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate this public health crisis through cooperative enforcement actions. Upon the President&#8217;s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order shall be removed. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions. Sec. 4. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 5. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Upon the President’s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order shall be removed. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Background. On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure of Mexico to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept Mexican drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Mexico. Sec. 2. Immediate Steps . Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February 1, 2025, titled &#8220;Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border&#8221; (&#8220;the Executive Order of February 1, 2025&#8221;), I have determined that the Government of Mexico has taken immediate steps designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis through cooperative actions. Further time is needed, however, to assess whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our southern border. Sec. 3. Pause. (a) In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Mexico, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty shall be paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 am eastern time. Accordingly, sections 2(a), sections 2(d), and section 2(e) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended by striking the term &#8220;February 4, 2025,&#8221; where it appears in those sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term &#8220;March, 4, 2025.&#8221; The exceptions set forth in section 2(a) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn. (b) During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall continue to assess the situation at our southern border, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025. (c) If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the Government of Mexico fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025. Sec. 4. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Background. On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure of Canada to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada. Sec. 2. Immediate Steps. Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February 1, 2025, titled “Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Northern Border” (“the Executive Order of February 1, 2025”), I have determined that the Government of Canada has taken immediate steps designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis through cooperative actions. Further time is needed, however, to assess whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our northern border. Sec. 3. Pause . (a) In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Canada, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rates of duty, and 10 percent ad valorem rates of duty as to energy products, shall be paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. eastern time. Accordingly, section 2(a), section 2(b), section 2(e), and section 2(f) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended by striking the term “February 4, 2025,” where it appears in those sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term “March 4, 2025.” The exceptions set forth in section 2(a) and section 2(b) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn. (b) During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security shall continue to assess the situation at our northern border, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025. (c) If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the Government of Canada fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025. Sec. 4. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Policy and Purpose. In recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women&#8217;s sports. This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports. Moreover, under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX), educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.&nbsp; As some Federal courts have recognized, &#8220;ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities.&#8221;&nbsp; Tennessee v. Cardona , 24-cv-00072 at 73 (E.D. Ky. 2024). See also Kansas v. U.S. Dept. of Education , 24-cv-04041 at 23 (D. Kan. 2024) (highlighting &#8220;Congress&#8217; goals of protecting biological women in education&#8221;).&nbsp; Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.&nbsp; It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women&#8217;s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth. Sec. 2. Definitions. The definitions in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government), shall apply to this order. Sec.3. Preserving Women&#8217;s Sports in Education. (a) In furtherance of the purposes of Title IX, the Secretary of Education shall promptly: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in coordination with the Attorney General, continue to comply with the vacatur of the rule entitled &#8220;Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance&#8221; of April 29, 2024, 89 FR 33474, see Tennessee v. Cardona , 24-cv-00072 at 13-15 (E.D. Ky. 2025), and take other appropriate action to ensure this regulation does not have effect; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;take all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms and thereby provide the equal opportunity guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, including enforcement actions described in subsection (iii); to bring regulations and policy guidance into line with the Congress&#8217; existing demand for &#8220;equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes&#8221; by clearly specifying and clarifying that women&#8217;s sports are reserved for women; and the resolution of pending litigation consistent with this policy; and (iii) &nbsp;prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions (including athletic associations composed of or governed by such institutions) that deny female students an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them, in the women&#8217;s category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males. (b) &nbsp;All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order. (c) &nbsp;The Department of Justice shall provide all necessary resources, in accordance with law, to relevant agencies to ensure expeditious enforcement of the policy established in this order.&nbsp; Sec. 4. Preserving Fairness and Safety in Women&#8217;s Sports . Many sport-specific governing bodies have no official position or requirements regarding trans-identifying athletes. Others allow men to compete in women&#8217;s categories if these men reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of &#8220;sincerely held&#8221; gender identity. These policies are unfair to female athletes and do not protect female safety. To address these concerns, it is hereby ordered: (a) &nbsp;The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall, within 60 days of the date of this order: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; convene representatives of major athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by such policies, to promote policies that are fair and safe, in the best interests of female athletes, and consistent with the requirements of Title IX, as applicable; and (ii)&nbsp; convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women to participate in sports and educate them about stories of women and girls who have been harmed by male participation in women&#8217;s sports. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of State, including through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs&#8217; Sports Diplomacy Division and the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, shall: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; rescind support for and participation in people-to-people sports exchanges or other sports programs within which the relevant female sports category is based on identity and not sex; and (ii)&nbsp; promote, including at the United Nations, international rules and norms governing sports competition to protect a sex-based female sports category, and, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, convene international athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by policies that allow male participation in women&#8217;s sports, to promote sporting policies that are fair, safe, and in furtherance of the best interests of female athletes. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women&#8217;s sports, and shall issue guidance with an objective of preventing such entry to the extent permitted by law, including pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)). (d) &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall use all appropriate and available measures to see that the International Olympic Committee amends the standards governing Olympic sporting events to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women&#8217;s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction. Sec. 5. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

Purpose and Policy. It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government. The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government. For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment. Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ), further prohibit government interference with Americans&#8217; rights to exercise their religion. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. ), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus. Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses. The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities. Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration. I rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases. At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored. After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law. Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that &#8220;radical-traditionalist&#8221; Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as &#8220;threat mitigation.&#8221; This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources. The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses. The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith. And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system. The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 &#8212; Easter Sunday &#8212; as &#8220;Transgender Day of Visibility.&#8221; In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018. Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism. My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians. The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms. My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified. Sec. 2.

Purpose and Policy. It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government. The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government. For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment. Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ), further prohibit government interference with Americans’ rights to exercise their religion. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. ), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus. Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses. The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities. Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration. I rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases. At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored. After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law. Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that “radical-traditionalist” Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as “threat mitigation.” This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources. The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses. The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith. And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system. The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 — Easter Sunday — as “Transgender Day of Visibility.” In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018. Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism. My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians. The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms. My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified. Sec. 2. Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias. (a) There is hereby established within the Department of Justice the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias (Task Force). (b) The Attorney General shall serve as Chair of the Task Force. (c) In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall consist of the following other members: (i) the Secretary of State; (ii) the Secretary of the Treasury; (iii) the Secretary of Defense; (iv) the Secretary of Labor; (v) the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (vi) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (vii) the Secretary of Education; (viii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; (ix) the Secretary of Homeland Security; (x) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (xi) Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations; (xii) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; (xiii) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (xiv) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; (xv) the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; (xvi) the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and (xvii) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices that the Chair may, from time to time, invite to participate.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel. &nbsp;The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. &nbsp;The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC.&nbsp; Neither country has ever recognized the ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war. &nbsp;The ICC&#8217;s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. &nbsp;This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel. &nbsp;Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers&#8217; Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 et seq. ) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, &#8220;In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.&#8221; (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction. &nbsp;The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC&#8217;s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp; I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat.&nbsp; I hereby determine and order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the person listed in the Annex to this order; and (ii)&nbsp; any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: (A) &nbsp;to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that person&#8217;s country of nationality; (B) &nbsp;to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (C) &nbsp;to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) &nbsp;The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 2. &nbsp;I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 3. &nbsp;The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 4. &nbsp;The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United&nbsp;States, and the entry of such persons into the United&nbsp;States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person&#8217;s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. &nbsp;In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. &nbsp;Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 5. &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a report on additional persons that should be included within the scope of section 1 of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 6. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) &nbsp;Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 7. &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 8. &nbsp;For the purposes of this order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the term &#8220;person&#8221; means an individual or entity; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the term &#8220;entity&#8221; means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;the term &#8220;United States person&#8221; means any United&nbsp;States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or any person lawfully in the United States; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;the term &#8220;protected person&#8221; means: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; any United States person, unless the United States provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A)&nbsp; current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States; (B)&nbsp; current or former elected or appointed officials of the United States Government; and (C)&nbsp; any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; and (ii)&nbsp; any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A)&nbsp; current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the United States; (B)&nbsp; current or former elected or appointed government officials of such ally of the United States; and (C)&nbsp; any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of such a government; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;the term &#8220;ally of the United States&#8221; means: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or (ii)&nbsp; a government of a &#8220;major non-NATO ally,&#8221; as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers&#8217; Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7)); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;the term &#8220;immediate family member&#8221; means a spouse or child; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g) &nbsp;the term &#8220;alien&#8221; has the meanings given to the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)); and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) &nbsp;the term &#8220;foreign person&#8221; means a person that is not a United States person. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 9. &nbsp;For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. &nbsp;I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 10. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. &nbsp;All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 11. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 12. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel. The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC. Neither country has ever recognized the ICC’s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war. The ICC’s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel. Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 et seq. ) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, “In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.” (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)). The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction. The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC’s jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives. The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat. I hereby determine and order: Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (i) the person listed in the Annex to this order; and (ii) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: (A) to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that person’s country of nationality; (B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order; and (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 4. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person’s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. Sec. 5. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a report on additional persons that should be included within the scope of section 1 of this order. Sec. 6. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 7. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. Sec. 8. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term “person” means an individual or entity; (b) the term “entity” means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; (c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or any person lawfully in the United States; (d) the term “protected person” means: (i) any United States person, unless the United States provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A) current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States; (B) current or former elected or appointed officials of the United States Government; and (C) any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; and (ii) any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A) current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the United States; (B) current or former elected or appointed government officials of such ally of the United States; and (C) any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of such a government; (e) the term “ally of the United States” means: (i) a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or (ii) a government of a “major non-NATO ally,” as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7)); (f) the term “immediate family member” means a spouse or child; (g) the term “alien” has the meanings given to the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)); and (h) the term “foreign person” means a person that is not a United States person. Sec. 9. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 11. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 12. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Policy . Faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship have tremendous ability to serve individuals, families, and communities through means that are different from those of government and with capacity and effectiveness that often exceeds that of government. These organizations lift people up, keep families strong, and solve problems at the local level. The executive branch wants faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to compete on a level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other Federal funding opportunities. The efforts of faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship are essential to strengthening families and revitalizing communities, and the Federal Government welcomes opportunities to partner with such organizations through innovative, measurable, and outcome-driven initiatives. The executive branch is committed to ensuring that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) honor and enforce the Constitution&#8217;s guarantee of religious liberty and to ending any form of religious discrimination by the Federal Government.

(b) Executive Order 13279, as amended by Executive Order 13559, is further amended by striking section 2(h) and redesignating sections 2(i) and 2(j) as sections 2(h) and 2(i), respectively. Sec. 3.

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Office shall: (i) from time to time, consult with and seek information from experts and various faith and community leaders identified by the White House Faith Office and other EOP components, including those from outside the Federal Government and those from State, local, and Tribal governments. These experts and leaders shall be identified based on their expertise in a broad range of areas in which faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship operate, including protecting women and children; strengthening marriage and family; lifting up individuals through work and self-sufficiency, defending religious liberty; combatting anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, and additional forms of anti-religious bias; promoting foster care and adoption programs in partnership with faith-based entities; providing wholesome and effective education; preventing and reducing crime and facilitating prisoner reentry; promoting recovery from substance use disorder; and fostering flourishing minds; (ii) make recommendations to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, regarding changes to policies, programs, and practices, and aspects of my Administration&#8217;s policy agenda, that affect the ability of faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to serve families and communities; (iii) convene meetings with representatives from the Centers for Faith and other representatives from across agencies as appropriate; (iv) advise on the implementation throughout the Federal Government of those aspects of my Administration&#8217;s policy agenda aimed at enabling faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve families and communities; (v) showcase innovative initiatives by faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship that serve and strengthen individuals, families, and communities throughout the United States; (vi) coordinate with all agencies to implement training and education throughout the country for faith-based entity grantees to build their capacity to procure grants; (vii) support agencies in developing and implementing training and education regarding religious liberty exceptions, accommodations, or exemptions; (viii) consult with public and private businesses regarding their policies for employee volunteerism, charitable giving, and payroll deductions; (ix) coordinate with agencies on identifying and promoting grant opportunities for non-profit faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship, especially those inexperienced with public funding but that operate effective programs; (x) work in collaboration with the Attorney General, or a designee of the Attorney General, to identify concerns raised by faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship about any failures of the executive branch to enforce constitutional and Federal statutory protections for religious liberty; and (xi) identify and propose means to reduce burdens on the free exercise of religion, including legislative, regulatory, and other barriers to the full and active participation of faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship in government-funded or government-conducted activities and programs. (b) Agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide such information, support, and assistance to the Office as may assist the Office in fulfilling this order. (c) The Directors of each Center of Faith shall oversee their respective agency&#8217;s efforts to assist the Office in carrying out this order, and shall report on such efforts to agency leadership and the Office. Agencies that lack a Center for Faith shall designate or appoint a Faith Liaison within the agency to oversee the agency&#8217;s efforts to assist the Office in carrying out this order and to report on such efforts to agency leadership and the Office. All such agencies shall designate or appoint such a Faith Liaison within 90 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose and Policy. Since its enactment in 1977, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 78dd-1 et seq .) (FCPA) has been systematically, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States. Current FCPA enforcement impedes the United States&#8217; foreign policy objectives and therefore implicates the President&#8217;s Article II authority over foreign affairs. The President&#8217;s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked with the global economic competitiveness of American companies. American national security depends in substantial part on the United States and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets. But overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses &#8212; by our own Government &#8212; for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security. It is therefore the policy of my Administration to preserve the Presidential authority to conduct foreign affairs and advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad. Sec. 2. Policy of Enforcement Discretion. (a) For a period of 180 days following the date of this order, the Attorney General shall review guidelines and policies governing investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA. During the review period, the Attorney General shall: (i) cease initiation of any new FCPA investigations or enforcement actions, unless the Attorney General determines that an individual exception should be made; (ii) review in detail all existing FCPA investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect to such matters to restore proper bounds on FCPA enforcement and preserve Presidential foreign policy prerogatives; and (iii) issue updated guidelines or policies, as appropriate, to adequately promote the President&#8217;s Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs and prioritize American interests, American economic competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of Federal law enforcement resources. (b) The Attorney General may extend such review period for an additional 180 days as the Attorney General determines appropriate. (c) FCPA investigations and enforcement actions initiated or continued after the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section: (i) shall be governed by such guidelines or policies; and (ii) must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General. (d) After the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall determine whether additional actions, including remedial measures with respect to inappropriate past FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, are warranted and shall take any such appropriate actions or, if Presidential action is required, recommend such actions to the President. Sec. 3. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 4. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Policy. An irrational campaign against plastic straws has resulted in major cities, States, and businesses banning the use or automatic inclusion of plastic straws with beverages. Plastic straws are often replaced by paper straws, which are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws. Additionally, paper straws sometimes come individually wrapped in plastic, undermining the environmental argument for their use. It is therefore the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws. Sec. 2. Purchases of Paper Straws by the Federal Government. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to eliminate the procurement of paper straws and otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.

Purpose . Article II of the United States Constitution vests the power to conduct foreign policy in the President of the United States. Presidents rely on their Secretaries of State and their subordinate officials to ensure that the United States is served and protected at home and abroad. As the principal steward of the President&#8217;s foreign policy, the Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively. Sec . 2 . Policy . All officers or employees charged with implementing the foreign policy of the United States must under Article II do so under the direction and authority of the President. Failure to faithfully implement the President&#8217;s policy is grounds for professional discipline, including separation. The personnel procedures of executive departments and agencies (agencies) charged with implementing the President&#8217;s foreign policy must therefore provide an effective and efficient means for ensuring that officers and employees faithfully implement the President&#8217;s policies. Sec . 3 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) the terms &#8220;Department,&#8221; &#8220;Foreign Service,&#8221; &#8220;Service,&#8221; and &#8220;Secretary&#8221; shall have the meaning given those terms by section 3902 of title 22, United States Code; and (b) the term &#8220;members of the Foreign Service&#8221; shall have the same meaning as &#8220;members of the Service&#8221; under section 3903 of title 22, United States Code. (c) the term &#8220;Civil Service employee&#8221; shall mean an employee of the Department holding United States citizenship, except for a member of the Foreign Service, as defined in section 2664a of title 22, United States Code. (d) the term &#8220;other staff&#8221; shall mean locally employed staff and agents under the authority of sections 202(a)(4)(A) (22 U.S.C. 3922(a)(4)(A)) and 303 (22 U.S.C. 3943) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, or special Government employees of the Department as defined in section 202(a) of title 18, United States Code. Sec . 4 . Election of Procedures . When the Secretary concludes that a member of the Foreign Service, a Civil Service employee, or other staff has demonstrated performance or conduct that warrants a personnel action, the Secretary shall, with respect to officials appointed by the Secretary or others within the Department, take appropriate action, subject to the supervision of the President, and shall, with respect to officials appointed by the President, preliminarily determine whether to refer such a matter for the President&#8217;s consideration. Such preliminary determination shall be made in the Secretary&#8217;s sole and exclusive discretion. Sec . 5 . Foreign Service Reform . (a) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President&#8217;s foreign policy agenda. (b) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation, and retention standards, and the programs of the Foreign Service Institute, to ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of the President&#8217;s foreign policy. (c) In implementing the reforms identified in this section, the Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual and direct subordinate agencies to remove, amend, or replace any handbooks, procedures, or guidance. (d) The Secretary shall have sole and exclusive discretion in the exercise or delegation of the responsibilities enumerated in this order, and, as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, may prescribe additional procedures that subordinate officials shall follow in the performance of such responsibilities. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre‑COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness. These realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. &nbsp;Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. &nbsp;Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88&nbsp;percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. &nbsp;In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe,&nbsp;Asia, or Africa. &nbsp;Autism spectrum disorders had the highest&nbsp;prevalence in high-income countries, including the United&nbsp;States, in 2021. &nbsp;Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. &nbsp;Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action. This concern applies urgently to America&#8217;s children. &nbsp;In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. &nbsp;Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States &#8212; a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the&nbsp;condition during the 1980s. &nbsp;Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to&nbsp;30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40&nbsp;percent of adolescents are overweight or obese. These health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. &nbsp;For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder &#8212; up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020 &#8212; and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise. &nbsp; This poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. &nbsp;Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. &nbsp;Ninety percent of the Nation&#8217;s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. &nbsp;In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. &nbsp;These trends harm us, our economy, and our security. To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. &nbsp;This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. &nbsp;We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. &nbsp;We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease. Sec . 2 . Policy . It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease. Under this policy: (a) &nbsp;all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust; (b) &nbsp;the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick; (c) &nbsp;agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and (d) &nbsp;agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention. Sec . 3 . Establishment and Composition of the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Commission), chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director). (b) &nbsp;In addition to the Chair and the Executive Director, the Commission shall include the following officials, or their designees: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Agriculture; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (iii)&nbsp; &nbsp;the Secretary of Education; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (vii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy; (viii) &nbsp;the Director of the National Economic Council; (ix) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; (x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; (xi)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the Commissioner of Food and Drugs; (xii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (xiii) &nbsp;the Director of the National Institutes of Health; and (xiv)&nbsp; &nbsp;other members of my Administration invited to participate, at the discretion of the Chair and the Executive Director. Sec . 4 . Fighting Childhood Chronic Disease . The initial mission of the Commission shall be to advise and assist the President on how best to exercise his authority to address the childhood chronic disease crisis. Therefore, the Commission shall: (a) &nbsp;study the scope of the childhood chronic disease crisis and any potential contributing causes, including the American diet, absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, Government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism; &nbsp; (b) &nbsp;advise and assist the President on informing the American people regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, using transparent and clear facts; and (c) &nbsp;provide to the President Government-wide recommendations on policy and strategy related to addressing the identified contributing causes of and ending the childhood chronic disease crisis. Sec . 5 . Initial Assessment and Strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission . (a) Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment. Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment, which shall: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;identify and describe childhood chronic disease in America compared to other countries; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures pose to children with respect to chronic inflammation or other established mechanisms of disease, using rigorous and transparent data, including international comparisons; (iii)&nbsp; &nbsp;assess the prevalence of and threat posed by&nbsp;the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and report on best practices for preventing childhood health issues, including through proper nutrition and the promotion of healthy lifestyles; (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluate the effectiveness of existing educational programs with regard to nutrition, physical activity, and mental health for children; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and evaluate existing Federal programs and funding intended to prevent and treat childhood health issues for their scope and effectiveness; (vii) &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure transparency of all current data and unpublished analyses related to the childhood chronic disease crisis, consistent with applicable law; (viii) &nbsp;evaluate the effectiveness of current Federal Government childhood health data and metrics, including those from the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and the National Survey of Children&#8217;s Health; (ix)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;restore the integrity of science, including by&nbsp;eliminating undue industry influence, releasing findings and underlying data to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and increasing methodological rigor; and (x)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;establish a framework for transparency and ethics review in industry-funded projects. (b) &nbsp; Make our Children Healthy Again Strategy. &nbsp;Within 180&nbsp;days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, a Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy (Strategy), based on the findings from the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment described in subsection (a) of this section.&nbsp; The Strategy shall address appropriately restructuring the Federal Government&#8217;s response to the childhood chronic disease crisis, including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease. (c) &nbsp;The Chair may hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and similar events, as appropriate, and may receive expert input from leaders in public health and Government accountability.&nbsp; Sec . 6 . Additional Reports . (a) Following the submission to the President of the Strategy, and any final strategy reports thereafter, the Chair and the Executive Director shall recommend to the President updates to the Commission&#8217;s mission, including desired reports. (b) &nbsp;The Commission shall not reconvene, following submission of the Strategy, until an updated mission is submitted to the President through the Executive Director. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall provide to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a plan to end coercive COVID-19 school mandates, consistent with applicable law, and including, as appropriate, any proposed legislation. Such plan shall also include: (i) a list of discretionary Federal grants and contracts provided to elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that are non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; and (ii) each executive department or agency&#8217;s process for, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, preventing Federal funds from being provided to, and rescinding Federal funds from, elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that are non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

Policy and Purpose . The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President&#8217;s ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, previous administrations have allowed so-called &#8220;independent regulatory agencies&#8221; to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. &nbsp;These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. &nbsp;Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These practices undermine such regulatory agencies&#8217; accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. &nbsp;For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people&#8217;s&nbsp;elected President. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials&#8217; accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of&nbsp;the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. &nbsp;Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and&nbsp;final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the&nbsp; Federal Register .&nbsp; Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The term &#8220;employees&#8221; shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;independent regulatory agency&#8221; shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code. &nbsp;This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. &nbsp;This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;independent regulatory agency chairman&#8221; shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency&#8217;s&nbsp;chairman, director, or other presiding officer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;The term &#8220;head&#8221; of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies&#8217; authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;3. &nbsp;OIRA Review of Agency Regulations. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (&#8220;Regulatory Planning and Review&#8221;), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;(b)&nbsp; &#8220;Agency,&#8221; unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an &#8220;agency&#8221; under 44&nbsp;U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall also include the Federal Election Commission. &nbsp;This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. &nbsp;This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866. &nbsp;Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such implementation guidance. &nbsp; Sec . 4 . Performance Standards and Management Objectives . The Director of OMB shall establish performance standards and management objectives for independent agency heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report periodically to the President on their performance and efficiency in attaining such standards and objectives. Sec . 5 . Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies . The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;review independent regulatory agencies&#8217; obligations for consistency with the President&#8217;s policies and priorities; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies&#8217; apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President&#8217;s&nbsp;policies and priorities. &nbsp;Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law.&nbsp; Sec . 6 . Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President . (a) Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the White House National Economic Council. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies. &nbsp;Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993&nbsp;to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization.&nbsp; Sec . 7 . Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees&#8217; Interpretation of the Law . The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President&#8217;s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch. The President and the Attorney General&#8217;s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties. No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General&#8217;s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General. Sec . 8 . General Provisions . (a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp; News Administration Issues Contact Visit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 X Instagram Facebook WH.GOV Copyright Privacy",10030,"Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies –  Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies EXECUTIVE ORDER February 18, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 .

Purpose . The plain text of Federal law, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) (PRWORA), generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits. Title IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that “aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,” and that “[i]t is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.” But in the decades since the passage of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law. Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources. My Administration will uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans. Sec . 2 . Preserving Federal Public Benefits . (a) To prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States, and to ensure, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall: (i) identify all federally funded programs administered by the agency that currently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit, and, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to align such programs with the purposes of this order and the requirements of applicable Federal law, including the PRWORA; (ii) ensure, consistent with applicable law, that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called “sanctuary” policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation; and (iii) enhance eligibility verification systems, to the maximum extent possible, to ensure that taxpayer-funded benefits exclude any ineligible alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully present in the United States. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Administrator of the United States DOGE Service, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall further: (i) identify all other sources of Federal funding for illegal aliens; and (ii) recommend additional agency actions to align Federal spending with the purposes of this order, and, where relevant, enhance eligibility verification systems. (c) Agencies shall refer any improper receipt or use of Federal benefits to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security for appropriate action. Sec . 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

After five weeks of unrelenting warfare, the island was declared secure, and our victory advanced America&#8217;s cause in the Pacific Theater &#8212; but at a staggering cost.&nbsp; Of the 70,000 men assembled for the campaign, nearly 7,000 Marines and Sailors died, and 20,000 more were wounded.

Purpose . It is the policy of my Administration to focus the executive branch&#8217;s limited enforcement resources on regulations squarely authorized by constitutional Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state. Ending Federal overreach and restoring the constitutional separation of powers is a priority of my Administration. Sec . 2 . Rescinding Unlawful Regulations and Regulations That Undermine the National Interest . (a) Agency heads shall, in coordination with their DOGE Team Leads and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, initiate a process to review all regulations subject to their sole or joint jurisdiction for consistency with law and Administration policy. Within 60 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall, in consultation with the Attorney General as appropriate, identify the following classes of regulations: (i) unconstitutional regulations and regulations that raise serious constitutional difficulties, such as exceeding the scope of the power vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution; (ii) regulations that are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power; (iii) regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition; (iv) regulations that implicate matters of social, political, or economic significance that are not authorized by clear statutory authority; (v) regulations that impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits; (vi) regulations that harm the national interest by significantly and unjustifiably impeding technological innovation, infrastructure development, disaster response, inflation reduction, research and development, economic development, energy production, land use, and foreign policy objectives; and (vii) regulations that impose undue burdens on small business and impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship. (b) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of &#8220;significant regulatory action&#8221; in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (c) Within 60 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall provide to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget a list of all regulations identified by class as listed in subsection (a) of this section.

Enforcement Discretion to Ensure Lawful Governance . (a) Subject to their paramount obligation to discharge their legal obligations, protect public safety, and advance the national interest, agencies shall preserve their limited enforcement resources by generally de-prioritizing actions to enforce regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of a statute and de-prioritizing actions to enforce regulations that go beyond the powers vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution. (b) Agency heads shall determine whether ongoing enforcement of any regulations identified in their regulatory review is compliant with law and Administration policy. To preserve resources and ensure lawful enforcement, agency heads, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, on a case-by-case basis and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, then direct the termination of all such enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy. Sec . 4 . Promulgation of New Regulations . Agencies shall continue to follow the processes set out in Executive Order 12866 for submitting regulations for review by OIRA. Additionally, agency heads shall consult with their DOGE Team Leads and the Administrator of OIRA on potential new regulations as soon as practicable. In evaluating potential new regulations, agency heads, DOGE Team Leads, and the Administrator of OIRA shall consider, in addition to the factors set out in Executive Order 12866, the factors set out in section 2(a) of this order. Sec . 5 . Implementation . The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue implementation guidance, as appropriate. Sec . 6 . Definitions . (a) &#8220;Agency&#8221; has the meaning given to it in 44 U.S.C. 3502, except it does not include the Executive Office of the President or its components. (b) &#8220;Agency head&#8221; shall mean the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director. (c) &#8220;DOGE Team Lead&#8221; shall mean the leader of the DOGE Team at each agency as described in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221;). (d) &#8220;Enforcement action&#8221; means all attempts, civil or criminal, by any agency to deprive a private party of life, liberty, or property, or in any way affect a private party&#8217;s rights or obligations, regardless of the label the agency has historically placed on the action. (e) &#8220;Regulation&#8221; shall have the meaning given to &#8220;regulatory action&#8221; in section 3(e) of Executive Order 12866, and also includes any &#8220;guidance document&#8221; as defined in Executive Order 13422 of January 18, 2007 (Further Amendment to Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review). (f) &#8220;Senior appointee&#8221; means an individual appointed by the President, or performing the functions and duties of an office that requires appointment by the President, or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service (or equivalent agency system).

(b) Agency heads shall determine whether ongoing enforcement of any regulations identified in their regulatory review is compliant with law and Administration policy. To preserve resources and ensure lawful enforcement, agency heads, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, on a case-by-case basis and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, then direct the termination of all such enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy.

In evaluating potential new regulations, agency heads, DOGE Team Leads, and the Administrator of OIRA shall consider, in addition to the factors set out in Executive Order 12866, the factors set out in section 2(a) of this order. Sec . 5 . Implementation . The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue implementation guidance, as appropriate. Sec . 6 . Definitions . (a) “Agency” has the meaning given to it in 44 U.S.C. 3502, except it does not include the Executive Office of the President or its components. (b) “Agency head” shall mean the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director. (c) “DOGE Team Lead” shall mean the leader of the DOGE Team at each agency as described in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency”). (d) “Enforcement action” means all attempts, civil or criminal, by any agency to deprive a private party of life, liberty, or property, or in any way affect a private party’s rights or obligations, regardless of the label the agency has historically placed on the action. (e) “Regulation” shall have the meaning given to “regulatory action” in section 3(e) of Executive Order 12866, and also includes any “guidance document” as defined in Executive Order 13422 of January 18, 2007 (Further Amendment to Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review).

Purpose . In recent years, the gross domestic product of the United States&#8217; digital economy alone, driven by cutting-edge American technology companies, has been bigger than the entire economy of Australia, Canada, or most members of the European Union. Instead of empowering their own workers and economies, foreign governments have increasingly exerted extraterritorial authority over American companies, particularly in the technology sector, hindering these companies&#8217; success and appropriating revenues that should contribute to our Nation&#8217;s well-being, not theirs. Beginning in 2019, several trading partners enacted digital services taxes (DSTs) that could cost American companies billions of dollars and that foreign government officials openly admit are designed to plunder American companies. Foreign countries have additionally adopted regulations governing digital services that are more burdensome and restrictive on United States companies than their own domestic companies. Additional foreign legal regimes limit cross-border data flows, require American streaming services to fund local productions, and charge network usage and Internet termination fees. All of these measures violate American sovereignty and offshore American jobs, limit American companies&#8217; global competitiveness, and increase American operational costs while exposing our sensitive information to potentially hostile foreign regulators. My Administration will not allow American companies and workers and American economic and national security interests to be compromised by one-sided, anti-competitive policies and practices of foreign governments. American businesses will no longer prop up failed foreign economies through extortive fines and taxes. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of my Administration that where a foreign government, through its tax or regulatory structure, imposes a fine, penalty, tax, or other burden that is discriminatory, disproportionate, or designed to transfer significant funds or intellectual property from American companies to the foreign government or the foreign government&#8217;s favored domestic entities, my Administration will act, imposing tariffs and taking such other responsive actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States and to repair any resulting imbalance. In taking such responsive action, my Administration shall consider: (a) taxes imposed on United States companies by foreign governments, including those that may discriminate against United States companies; (b) regulations imposed on United States companies by foreign governments that could inhibit the growth or intended operation of United States companies; (c) any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that could require a United States company to jeopardize its intellectual property; and (d) Any other act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that serves to undermine the global competitiveness of United States companies. Sec . 3 . Agency Responsibilities . (a) The United States Trade Representative shall determine, in accordance with applicable law, whether to renew investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) of the DSTs of France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, which were initiated under my Administration on July 16, 2019, and June 5, 2020. If the United States Trade Representative determines to renew such investigations, he shall take all appropriate and feasible action in response to those DSTs. (b) The United States Trade Representative shall determine, consistent with section 302(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)) (section 302(b)), whether to investigate the DST of any other country that may discriminate against United States companies or burden or restrict United States commerce. He shall further determine whether to pursue a panel under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the DST imposed by Canada and whether to investigate Canada&#8217;s DST under section 302(b). In making these determinations, the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate. (c) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall jointly identify trade and other regulatory practices by other countries, including, without limitation, those described in section 2 of this memorandum, that discriminate against, disproportionately affect, or otherwise undermine the global competitiveness or intended operation of United States companies, in the digital economy and more generally, and recommend to me appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) (America First Trade Policy Memorandum). (d) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall investigate whether any act, policy, or practice of any country in the European Union or the United Kingdom has the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development of United States companies&#8217; products or services in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content, and recommend appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum. (e) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall determine whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or companies, including, without limitation, in the digital economy, to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, or has any tax measure in place that otherwise undermines the global competitiveness of United States companies, is inconsistent with any tax treaty of the United States, or is otherwise actionable under section 891 of title 26, United States Code, or other tax-related legal authority. The Secretary of the Treasury shall include the results of this determination as part of the report required in section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal). (f) The United States Trade Representative shall identify tools the United States can use to secure among trading partners a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum. (g) The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, shall establish a process that allows American businesses to report to the United States Trade Representative foreign tax or regulatory practices that disproportionately harm United States companies. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions America First Investment Policy The White House February 21, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE THE SECRETARY OF LABOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION SUBJECT: America First Investment Policy By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: Section 1 . Principles and Objectives . America&#8217;s investment policy is critical to our national and economic security. Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening the United States&#8217; world-leading private and public capital markets will be a key part of America&#8217;s Golden Age. The United States has the world&#8217;s most attractive assets, in technology and across our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States economic growth with their capital. Investment by United States allies and partners can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United States. Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving threats that can accompany foreign investment. Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest, however. Certain foreign adversaries, including the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries. The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries. Economic security is national security. The PRC does not allow United States companies to take over their critical infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take over United States critical infrastructure. PRC-affiliated investors are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping terminals. The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United States homeland and Armed Forces of the United States around the world. Related actions include the development and deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber‑enabled actions against the United States and its people. Through its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies and research institutions to support its military and intelligence activities. Those Chinese companies also raise capital by: selling to American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible benefits. In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance and advance the development and modernization of its military. Sec . 2 . Policy . (a) It is the policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in the United States. Investment in our economy from our allies and partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports the national interest. My Administration will make the United States the world&#8217;s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit of all of us. (b) Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors&#8217; access to United States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors. (c) The United States will create an expedited &#8220;fast-track&#8221; process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses involved with United States advanced technology and other important areas. This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign adversaries. (d) My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion in the United States. (e) The United States will reduce the exploitation of public and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by foreign adversaries such as the PRC. The United States will establish new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing in industries that advance the PRC&#8217;s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that serve American interests. (f) The United States will use all necessary legal instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors. My Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities. It will also seek, including in consultation with the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over &#8220;greenfield&#8221; investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence), and to expand the remit of &#8220;emerging and foundational&#8221; technologies addressable by CFIUS. (g) To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative burden, and increase Government efficiency, my Administration will cease the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended &#8220;mitigation&#8221; agreements for United States investments from foreign adversary countries. In general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than perpetual and expensive compliance obligations. More administrative resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments from key partner countries. (h) The United States will continue to welcome and encourage passive investments from all foreign persons. These include non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence, substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or technical information, products, or services. This will allow our cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment capital, while ensuring protection of our national security. (i) The United States will also use all necessary legal instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the PRC&#8217;s military-industrial sector. These may include the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 &#8212; Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People&#8217;s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern). Executive Order 14105 is under review by my Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes sufficient controls to address national security threats. (j) This review will build on measures taken under my authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on United States outbound investment in the PRC in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and other areas implicated by the PRC&#8217;s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy. Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly, including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. As part of the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments, and other limited-partner investors. It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism. (k) To further reduce incentives for United States persons to invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or terminate the 1984 United States-The People&#8217;s Republic of China Income Tax Convention. That tax treaty, along with the PRC&#8217;s admission to the World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United States and the technological modernization of the PRC military. We will seek to reverse both those trends. United States investors will invest in the future of America, not the future of the PRC. (l) To protect the savings of United States investors and channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will also: (i) determine if adequate financial auditing standards are upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act; (ii) review the variable interest entity and subsidiary structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these companies; and (iii) restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan contributions. Sec . 3 . Implementation . The policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and available appropriations, and subject to internal programmatic and budgetary processes, as follows: (a) With respect to sections 2(a) through 2(k) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the purposes of this memorandum. (b) With respect to section 2(d) of this memorandum, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall carry out the purposes of this memorandum. (c) With respect to section 2(l)(i) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury shall engage as appropriate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; with respect to section 2(l)(ii) of this memorandum, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide a written recommendation on the risk posed to United States investors based on the auditability, corporate oversight, and evidence of criminal or civil fraudulent behavior for all foreign adversary companies currently listed on domestic exchanges; and with respect to section 2(l)(iii) of this memorandum, the Secretary of Labor shall publish updated fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for investments in public market securities of foreign adversary companies. Sec . 4 . Definition . For purposes of this memorandum, the term &#8220;foreign adversaries&#8221; includes the PRC, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region; the Republic of Cuba; the Islamic Republic of Iran; the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea; the Russian Federation; and the regime of Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i.) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY FROM IMPORTS OF COPPER The White House February 25, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended ( 19 U.S.C. 1862 ) (Trade Expansion Act), it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Policy . Copper is a critical material essential to the national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience of the United States. Copper, scrap copper, and copper&#8217;s derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted, and refined copper. The United States has ample copper reserves, yet our smelting and refining capacity lags significantly behind global competitors. A single foreign producer dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. This dominance, coupled with global overcapacity and a single producer&#8217;s control of world supply chains, poses a direct threat to United States national security and economic stability. It is the policy of the United States to ensure a reliable, secure, and resilient domestic copper supply chain. The United States&#8217; increasing dependence on foreign sources of copper, particularly from a concentrated number of supplier nations, along with the risk of foreign market manipulation, necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of copper, scrap copper, and copper&#8217;s derivative products threaten to impair national security. Sec . 2 . Investigation Into the National Security Impact of Copper Imports . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on national security of imports of copper in all forms, including but not limited to: (i) raw mined copper; (ii) copper concentrates; (iii) refined copper; (iv) copper alloys; (v) scrap copper; and (vi) derivative products. (b) In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled &#8220;Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,&#8221; as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) the current and projected demand for copper in United States defense, energy, and critical infrastructure sectors; (ii) the extent to which domestic production, smelting, refining, and recycling can meet demand; (iii) the role of foreign supply chains, particularly from major exporters, in meeting United States demand; (iv) the concentration of United States copper imports from a small number of suppliers and the associated risks; (v) the impact of foreign government subsidies, overcapacity, and predatory trade practices on United States industry competitiveness; (vi) the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices due to dumping and state-sponsored overproduction; (vii) the potential for export restrictions by foreign nations, including the ability of foreign nations to weaponize their control over refined copper supplies; (viii) the feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining, smelting, and refining capacity to reduce import reliance; and (ix) the impact of current trade policies on domestic copper production and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security. Sec . 3 . Required Actions . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with copper import dependency. (b) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes: (i) findings on whether United States dependence on copper imports threatens national security; (ii) recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and (iii) policy recommendations for strengthening the United States copper supply chain through strategic investments, permitting reforms, and enhanced recycling initiatives. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information The White House February 25, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took historic steps to correct a fundamental wrong within the American healthcare system. For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure. These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs. Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people. These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information. One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term. Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration&#8217;s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs. The American people deserve better. Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information The White House February 25, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took historic steps to correct a fundamental wrong within the American healthcare system. For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure. These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs. Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people. These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information. One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term. Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration’s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs. The American people deserve better. Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions. The Federal Government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information, potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements. Sec . 3 . Fulfilling the Promise of Radical Transparency . The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this order, action to: (a) require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services, not estimates; (b) issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans; and (c) issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Designating English as the Official Language of The United States The White House March 1, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose and Policy . From the founding of our Republic, English has been used as our national language. Our Nation&#8217;s historic governing documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, have all been written in English. It is therefore long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States. A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language. In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream. Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society. This order recognizes and celebrates the long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come.

A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language. In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream.

Purpose . The production of timber, lumber, paper, bioenergy, and other wood products (timber production) is critical to our Nation&#8217;s well-being. Timber production is essential for crucial human activities like construction and energy production. Furthermore, as recent disasters demonstrate, forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects can save American lives and communities. The United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers. Our inability to fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy, and threatened our economic security. These onerous Federal policies have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance. It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security. Sec . 2 . Directives to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Chief of the United States Forest Service (USFS), respectively, shall each issue new or updated guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber, and decrease timber supply uncertainty, such as the Good Neighbor Authority described in 16 U.S.C. 2113a, stewardship contracting pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 6591c, and agreements or contracts with Indian tribes under the Tribal Forest Protection Act as contemplated by 25 U.S.C. 3115a. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall also each submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget any legislative proposals that would expand authorities to improve timber production and sound forest management. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, shall complete a strategy on USFS and BLM forest management projects under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1536) to improve the speed of approving forestry projects. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the FWS, shall also examine any applicable existing authorities that would permit executive departments and agencies (agencies) to delegate consultation requirements under section 7 of the ESA to other agencies and, if necessary, provide a legislative proposal to ensure consultation is streamlined. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall together submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, a plan that sets a target for the annual amount of timber per year to be offered for sale over the next 4 years from Federal lands managed by the BLM and the USFS, measured in millions of board feet. (d) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Directors of the FWS and the BLM, and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the USFS, shall complete the Whitebark Pine Rangewide Programmatic Consultation under section 7 of the ESA. (e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adopt categorical exclusions administratively established by other agencies to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and reduce unnecessarily lengthy processes and associated costs related to administrative approvals for timber production, forest management, and wildfire risk reduction treatments. (f) Within 280 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, establish a new categorical exclusion for timber thinning and re-establish a categorical exclusion for timber salvage activities. Sec . 3 . Streamlined Permitting . All relevant agencies shall eliminate, to the maximum extent permissible by law, all undue delays within their respective permitting processes related to timber production. Additionally, all relevant agencies shall take all necessary and appropriate steps consistent with applicable law to suspend, revise, or rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an undue burden on timber production. Sec . 4 . Endangered Species Committee . (a) Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulations on consultations in emergencies to facilitate the Nation&#8217;s timber production. The Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman of the Endangered Species Committee, shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions to such committee, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure the timely consideration of exemption applications and, where possible, to resolve such applications before the deadlines set by the ESA. (b) Federal members of the Endangered Species Committee, or their designees, shall coordinate to develop and submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, that identifies obstacles to domestic timber production infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA and recommends procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the FWS, or the Director&#8217;s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other appropriate action concerning the applicability of the ESA&#8217;s emergency regulations. The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, or the Assistant Administrator&#8217;s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action as may assist in applying the ESA&#8217;s emergency regulations. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Policy . The wood products industry, composed of timber, lumber, and their derivative products (such as paper products, furniture, and cabinetry) is a critical manufacturing industry essential to the national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience of the United States. This industry plays a vital role in key downstream civilian industries, including construction. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being dumped onto the United States market. The United States has ample timber resources. The current United States softwood lumber industry has the practical production capacity to supply 95 percent of the United States&#8217; 2024 softwood consumption. Yet, since 2016 the United States has been a net importer of lumber. Wood products are a key input used by both the civilian construction industry and the military. Each year, the United States military spends over 10 billion dollars on construction. The military also invests in innovative building material technology, including processes to create innovative wood products such as cross-laminated timber. The procurement of these building materials depends on a strong domestic lumber industry and a manufacturing base capable of meeting both military-specific and wider civilian needs. It is the policy of the United States to ensure reliable, secure, and resilient domestic supply chains of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. Unfair subsidies and foreign government support for foreign timber, lumber, and their derivative products necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of these products threaten to impair national security. Sec . 2 . Investigation . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on the national security of imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. (b) In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled &#8220;Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,&#8221; as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) the current and projected demand for timber and lumber in the United States; (ii) the extent to which domestic production of timber and lumber can meet domestic demand; (iii) the role of foreign supply chains, particularly of major exporters, in meeting United States timber and lumber demand; (iv) the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices on United States timber, lumber, and derivative product industry competitiveness; (v) the feasibility of increasing domestic timber and lumber capacity to reduce imports; and (vi) the impact of current trade policies on domestic timber, lumber, and derivative product production, and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security. Sec . 3 . Required Actions . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. (b) No later than 270 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes: (i) findings on whether imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products threaten national security; (ii) recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and (iii) policy recommendations for strengthening the United States timber and lumber supply chain through strategic investments and permitting reforms. Sec . 4 . Definitions . As used in this order: (a) The term &#8220;timber&#8221; refers to wood that has not been processed. (b) The term &#8220;lumber&#8221; refers to wood that has been processed, including wood that has been milled and cut into boards or planks. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Background . With Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), I determined that the failure of the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, flowing from the PRC to the United States constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC, as defined by the Federal Register notice described in section 2(d) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China).

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray The White House March 5, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose and Policy . The prior administration&#8217;s immigration policies inexcusably endangered and caused enormous suffering within our Nation, including by causing the southern border to be overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics. These open-border policies are responsible for the horrific and inexcusable murders of many innocent American citizens at the hands of illegal aliens. One of those innocent victims was Jocelyn Nungaray, whose life was tragically cut short on June 17, 2024, when she was brutally murdered in Houston, Texas. Two Venezuelan illegal aliens who were allegedly Tren de Aragua gang members and were apprehended near the border in early 2024 &#8212; and then released into the United States by the prior administration &#8212; have been charged with her murder. Jocelyn was a precious 12 year old girl beloved by her family and friends for her kindness and infectious zeal for life. She loved animals and had a passion for ensuring that they had homes. It is fitting and in the national interest, therefore, that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, a scenic area for coastal wildlife and recreation along the Gulf of America near Jocelyn&#8217;s home in Texas, will forever honor and preserve the memory of a beautiful American, Jocelyn Nungaray. Sec. 2 . Renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge to Honor Jocelyn Nungaray . Within 30 days of the date of this order, pursuant to authority under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) and other applicable law, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall update procedures as necessary and take all other appropriate actions to rename the area known as the &#8220;Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge&#8221; as the &#8220;Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge&#8221; and ensure that her life is permanently commemorated therein. The Secretary shall subsequently provide guidance to ensure all Federal references to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications, reflect its renaming. Sec. 3. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

It is fitting and in the national interest, therefore, that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, a scenic area for coastal wildlife and recreation along the Gulf of America near Jocelyn’s home in Texas, will forever honor and preserve the memory of a beautiful American, Jocelyn Nungaray. Sec. 2 . Renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge to Honor Jocelyn Nungaray . Within 30 days of the date of this order, pursuant to authority under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) and other applicable law, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall update procedures as necessary and take all other appropriate actions to rename the area known as the “Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge” as the “Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge” and ensure that her life is permanently commemorated therein. The Secretary shall subsequently provide guidance to ensure all Federal references to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications, reflect its renaming. Sec. 3. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP The White House March 6, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . The dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP (&#8220;Perkins Coie&#8221;) has affected this country for decades. Notably, in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false &#8220;dossier&#8221; designed to steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court. In addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change. My Administration is committed to ending discrimination under &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec . 2 . Security Clearance Review . (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Perkins Coie. The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec . 3 . Contracting . (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, racial discrimination, falsified documents designed to weaponize the Government against candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and distrust, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that disclose doing business with Perkins Coie under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service; (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that do business with Perkins Coie effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec . 4 . Racial Discrimination . (a) The Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including whether large law firms: reserve certain positions, such as summer associate spots, for individuals of preferred races; promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access on a discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel on a discriminatory basis. (b) The Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in consultation with State Attorneys General as appropriate, shall investigate the practices of large law firms as described in subsection (a) of this section who do business with Federal entities for compliance with race-based and sex-based non-discrimination laws and take any additional actions the Attorney General deems appropriate in light of the evidence uncovered. Sec . 5 . Personnel . (a) The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(b) The additional rate of duty on potash that is not subject to subsection (a) of this section shall be reduced to 10 percent in lieu of 25 percent. (c) The modifications set out in this section shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on March 7, 2025. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose . In 2007, the Congress established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program to encourage Americans to enter the public service sector by promising to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments. The prior administration abused the PSLF Program through a waiver process, using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years away from the statutorily required number of payments. Moreover, instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means. The PSLF Program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low-need majors with unsustainable debt, and may push students into organizations that hide under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national interest, thus requiring additional Federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations&#8217; federally subsidized wrongdoing. As President of the United States, I have a duty to protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution and our national security, which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property, and disruption of the public order, which threaten the security and stability of the United States. Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration that individuals employed by organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness. Sec . 2 . Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness . The Secretary of Education shall propose revisions to 34 C.F.R. 685.219, Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate, that ensure the definition of &#8220;public service&#8221; excludes organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose, including: (a) aiding or abetting violations of 8 U.S.C. 1325 or other Federal immigration laws; (b) supporting terrorism, including by facilitating funding to, or the operations of, cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, or by engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy; (c) child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary States for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents, in violation of applicable law; (d) engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination; or (e) engaging in a pattern of violating State tort laws, including laws against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance, vandalism, and obstruction of highways. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

This anti-democratic takeover is orchestrated by forum-shopping organizations that repeatedly bring meritless suits, used for fundraising and political grandstanding, without any repercussions when they fail. &nbsp;Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for.&nbsp; Moreover, this situation results in the Department of Justice, the Nation&#8217;s chief law enforcement agency, dedicating substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety. The effective administration of justice in the Federal courts depends on mechanisms that deter frivolous litigation, protect parties from unwarranted costs, and streamline judicial processes.&nbsp; One key mechanism is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) (Rule 65(c)), which mandates that a party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (injunction) provide security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party if the injunction is wrongly issued.&nbsp; Consistent enforcement of this rule is critical to ensuring that taxpayers do not foot the bill for costs or damages caused by wrongly issued preliminary relief by activist judges and to achieving the effective administration of justice. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.&nbsp; Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions. Consistent with applicable law, the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in consultation with the Attorney General, are directed to ensure that their respective agencies properly request under Rule 65(c) that Federal district courts require plaintiffs to post security equal to the Federal Government&#8217;s potential costs and damages from a wrongly issued injunction. &nbsp;The scope of this directive covers all lawsuits filed against the Federal Government seeking an injunction where agencies can show expected monetary damages or costs from the requested preliminary relief, unless extraordinary circumstances justify an exception. In requests for security under Rule 65(c), agencies shall include, among other things, that: (a)&nbsp; Rule 65(c) mandates the court to require, in all applicable cases, that a movant for an injunction post security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party; (b)&nbsp; the security amount the agency is requesting is based on a reasoned assessment of the potential harm to the enjoined or restrained party; and (c)&nbsp; failure of the party that moved for preliminary relief to comply with Rule 65(c) results in denial or dissolution of the requested injunctive relief.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) The White House March 11, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES Subject: Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) In recent weeks, activist organizations fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and sometimes even Government grants have obtained sweeping injunctions far beyond the scope of relief contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, functionally inserting themselves into the executive policy making process and therefore undermining the democratic process. This anti-democratic takeover is orchestrated by forum-shopping organizations that repeatedly bring meritless suits, used for fundraising and political grandstanding, without any repercussions when they fail. &nbsp;Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for.&nbsp; Moreover, this situation results in the Department of Justice, the Nation&#8217;s chief law enforcement agency, dedicating substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety. The effective administration of justice in the Federal courts depends on mechanisms that deter frivolous litigation, protect parties from unwarranted costs, and streamline judicial processes.&nbsp; One key mechanism is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) (Rule 65(c)), which mandates that a party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (injunction) provide security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party if the injunction is wrongly issued.&nbsp; Consistent enforcement of this rule is critical to ensuring that taxpayers do not foot the bill for costs or damages caused by wrongly issued preliminary relief by activist judges and to achieving the effective administration of justice. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.&nbsp; Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions. Consistent with applicable law, the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in consultation with the Attorney General, are directed to ensure that their respective agencies properly request under Rule 65(c) that Federal district courts require plaintiffs to post security equal to the Federal Government&#8217;s potential costs and damages from a wrongly issued injunction. &nbsp;The scope of this directive covers all lawsuits filed against the Federal Government seeking an injunction where agencies can show expected monetary damages or costs from the requested preliminary relief, unless extraordinary circumstances justify an exception. In requests for security under Rule 65(c), agencies shall include, among other things, that: (a)&nbsp; Rule 65(c) mandates the court to require, in all applicable cases, that a movant for an injunction post security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party; (b)&nbsp; the security amount the agency is requesting is based on a reasoned assessment of the potential harm to the enjoined or restrained party; and (c)&nbsp; failure of the party that moved for preliminary relief to comply with Rule 65(c) results in denial or dissolution of the requested injunctive relief. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ADDRESSING RISKS FROM PAUL WEISS The White House March 14, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Background . Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles. Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono , or ostensibly &#8220;for the public good&#8221; &#8212; potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all. My Administration will no longer support taxpayer funds sponsoring such harm. My Administration has already taken action to address some of the significant risks and egregious conduct associated with law firms, and I have determined that similar action is necessary to end Government sponsorship of harmful activity by an additional law firm: Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss). In 2021, a Paul Weiss partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit against individuals alleged to have participated in the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General. In 2022, Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me and who, according to his co-workers, unethically led witnesses in ways designed to implicate me. After being unable to convince even Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged in a media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted prosecution. Additionally, Paul Weiss discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. Paul Weiss, along with nearly every other large, influential, or industry leading law firm, makes decisions around &#8220;targets&#8221; based on race and sex. My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimination perpetrated in the name of &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec . 2 . Security Clearance Review . (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Paul Weiss. The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec . 3 . Contracting . (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that disclose doing business with Paul Weiss under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any service; (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that do business with Paul Weiss effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec . 4 . Racial Discrimination . Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec . 5 . Personnel . (a) The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Paul Weiss when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Paul Weiss employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Paul Weiss, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua The White House March 15, 2025 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION Tren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking. TdA has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime&#8217;s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States. TdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus. TdA grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed as Vice President of Venezuela. Soon thereafter, the United States Department of the Treasury designated El Aissami as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. El Aissami is currently a United States fugitive facing charges arising from his violations of United States sanctions triggered by his Department of the Treasury designation. Like El Aissami, Nicolas Maduro, who claims to act as Venezuela&#8217;s President and asserts control over the security forces and other authorities in Venezuela, also maintains close ties to regime-sponsored narco-terrorists. Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los Soles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other organizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics as a weapon to &#8220;flood&#8221; the United States. In 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in connection with this plot against America. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. Indeed, in December 2024, INTERPOL Washington confirmed: &#8220;Tren de Aragua has emerged as a significant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela.&#8221; Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that TdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, attempt to invade, and threaten to invade the country; perpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug trafficking as a weapon against our citizens. Based upon a review of TdA&#8217;s activities, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, on February 20, 2025, acting pursuant to the authority in 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to protect the American people from the devastating effects of this invasion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., hereby proclaim and direct as follows: Section 1 . I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation&#8217;s foreign affairs under the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States. Sec . 2 . I direct the Attorney General, within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, to prepare and publish a letter under her signature declaring the policy described in section 1 of this proclamation as the policy of the United States and attaching this proclamation. I direct the Attorney General to transmit this letter to the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of every circuit court of appeals, the chief judge of every district and territorial court of the United States, each Governor of a State and territory of the United States, and the highest-ranking judicial officer of each State and territory of the United States. Sec . 3 . I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States. Sec . 4 . Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any Alien Enemy under any separate authority. Sec . 5 .

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua The White House March 15, 2025 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION Tren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking. TdA has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime’s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States. TdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus. TdA grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed as Vice President of Venezuela. Soon thereafter, the United States Department of the Treasury designated El Aissami as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. El Aissami is currently a United States fugitive facing charges arising from his violations of United States sanctions triggered by his Department of the Treasury designation. Like El Aissami, Nicolas Maduro, who claims to act as Venezuela’s President and asserts control over the security forces and other authorities in Venezuela, also maintains close ties to regime-sponsored narco-terrorists. Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los Soles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other organizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics as a weapon to “flood” the United States. In 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in connection with this plot against America. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. Indeed, in December 2024, INTERPOL Washington confirmed: “Tren de Aragua has emerged as a significant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela.” Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that TdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, attempt to invade, and threaten to invade the country; perpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug trafficking as a weapon against our citizens. Based upon a review of TdA’s activities, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, on February 20, 2025, acting pursuant to the authority in 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to protect the American people from the devastating effects of this invasion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., hereby proclaim and direct as follows: Section 1 . I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs under the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States. Sec . 2 . I direct the Attorney General, within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, to prepare and publish a letter under her signature declaring the policy described in section 1 of this proclamation as the policy of the United States and attaching this proclamation. I direct the Attorney General to transmit this letter to the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of every circuit court of appeals, the chief judge of every district and territorial court of the United States, each Governor of a State and territory of the United States, and the highest-ranking judicial officer of each State and territory of the United States. Sec . 3 . I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States. Sec . 4 . Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any Alien Enemy under any separate authority. Sec . 5 . All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall collaborate with law enforcement officials of the United States and with appropriate State, local, and tribal officials, to use all lawful means to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. Sec . 6 . Pursuant to my authority under 50 U.S.C. 21 to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States toward the Alien Enemies subject to this proclamation, to direct the manner and degree of the restraint to which such Alien Enemies shall be subject and in what cases, to provide for the removal of such Alien Enemies, and to establish any other regulations which are found necessary “in the premises and for the public safety,” I hereby direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to execute all the regulations hereinafter contained regarding the Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are further directed to cause the apprehension, detention, and removal of all members of TdA who otherwise qualify as Alien Enemies under section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are authorized to take all necessary actions under the Alien Enemies Act to effectuate this proclamation, consistent with applicable law. In doing so, and for such purpose, they are authorized to utilize agents, agencies, and officers of the United States Government and of the several States, territories, dependencies, and municipalities thereof and of the District of Columbia. All such agents, agencies, and officers are hereby granted full authority for all acts done by them in the execution of such regulations when acting by direction of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the case may be. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., I hereby declare and establish the following regulations which I find necessary “in the premises and for the public safety”: (a) No Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation shall enter, attempt to enter, or be found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Any such Alien Enemy who enters, attempts to enter, or is found within such territory shall be immediately apprehended and detained until removed from the United States. All such Alien Enemies, wherever found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are subject to summary apprehension. (b) Alien Enemies apprehended pursuant to this proclamation shall be subject to detention until removed from the United States in such place of detention as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations. (c) Alien Enemies shall be subject to removal to any such location as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations consistent with applicable law. (d) All property in the possession of, or traceable to, an Alien Enemy, which is used, intended to be used, or is commonly used to perpetrate the hostile activity and irregular warfare of TdA, along with evidence of such hostile activity and irregular warfare, shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture. The Attorney General is further granted authority, pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act and 3 U.S.C. 301, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to issue any guidance necessary to effectuate the prompt apprehension, detention, and removal of all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. Any such guidance shall be effective immediately upon issuance by the Attorney General. This proclamation and the directives and regulations prescribed herein shall extend and apply to all land and water, continental or insular, in any way within the jurisdiction of the United States.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . Many shippers based in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices. These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption under section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C)). As noted in Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), as amended by Executive Order 14228 of March 3, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), these exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States. In Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), I suspended the elimination of duty-free de minimis treatment on articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195. The Secretary of Commerce has notified me that adequate systems are now in place to process and collect tariff revenue for covered goods from the PRC otherwise eligible for duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available for products of the PRC (which include products of Hong Kong) described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, including international postal packages sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong, that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025. Additional duties for such imported merchandise shall be collected at the rates described in this order. Sec . 2 . Assessment of Duties on Low-Value Products of the PRC . (a) Other than articles sent to the United States through the international postal network (for which a duty is separately provided as described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section), all shipments of articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, that are products of the PRC or Hong Kong; that are sent to the United States; that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C); and that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, shall be entered by a party qualified to make entry under another appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security, with all applicable duties, including those imposed by section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, and paid in accordance with the applicable entry and payment procedures. Executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, through CBP, shall take all necessary actions to effectuate the objectives of this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register . The United States International Trade Commission shall continue to act ministerially by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as needed, to reflect the actions set out in this order. (b) Imposition of Duty. (i) All postal items containing goods described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195 and sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong and transported by carriers that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall be subject to the duties described in subsection (c) of this section. In order to address the threat of the PRC&#8217;s failure to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids into the United States, while allowing for the orderly flow of legitimate international mail, the duties imposed in subsection (c) of this section, except as required by applicable law, are imposed in lieu of any other duties that the shipments would otherwise be subject to, including the 20 percent ad valorem duty established in Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228; most-favored nation rates embodied in the HTSUS; and duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. (ii) CBP is authorized to require the carrier transporting the international postal package into the United States to remit payment of the duty described in subsection (c) of this section to CBP monthly or on such other periodic time frame as CBP determines appropriate, and CBP may issue regulations and guidance as necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce this requirement. (iii) All carriers that transport international postal packages from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States as part of or on behalf of the international postal network must report to CBP the total number of postal items containing goods and, if electing the duty rate specified in subsection (c)(i) of this section, the value of each postal item containing goods, transported per conveyance, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by CBP. CBP may require submission of documentation and information from the carrier to verify the total number and value of individual postal items containing goods to be electronically transmitted through the ACE. (c) Duty Rates. Transportation carriers delivering shipments to the United States from the PRC or Hong Kong sent through the international postal network must collect and remit duties to CBP under the approach outlined in either subsection (c)(i) or subsection (c)(ii) of this section. Transportation carriers must apply the same duty collection methodology to all shipments; however, transportation carriers may change their collection methodology once a month or on such other periodic timeframe as CBP determines appropriate, upon providing 24-hour notice to CBP. (i) Ad Valorem Duty. 30 percent of the value of the postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025. (ii) Specific Duty. 25 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, and 50 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025. (d) Bond Requirement. Any carrier that transports international postal items containing goods from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States, by any mode of transportation, must have an international carrier bond to ensure payment of the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. CBP is authorized to ensure that the international carrier bonds required by this subsection are sufficient to account for the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. (e) Discretion to Require Formal Entry. CBP may require formal entry, in accordance with existing regulations, for any international postal package that may otherwise be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. An international postal package for which CBP requires formal entry will not be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and instead will be subject to all applicable duties, taxes, and fees in accordance with all applicable laws. Sec . 3 . Implementation of Duty . The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to take all necessary actions to implement this order. Consistent with section 4 of Executive Order 14195, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec . 4 . Homeland Security Authorities . Nothing in this order limits the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to use any available legal authorities granted to ensure compliance with the provisions of this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President regarding the impact of this order on American industries, consumers, and supply chains and making recommendations for further action as he deems necessary, including a recommendation on whether extending de minimis ineligibility to packages from Macau is necessary to prevent circumvention of this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(a) Other than articles sent to the United States through the international postal network (for which a duty is separately provided as described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section), all shipments of articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, that are products of the PRC or Hong Kong; that are sent to the United States; that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C); and that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, shall be entered by a party qualified to make entry under another appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security, with all applicable duties, including those imposed by section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, and paid in accordance with the applicable entry and payment procedures. Executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, through CBP, shall take all necessary actions to effectuate the objectives of this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register . The United States International Trade Commission shall continue to act ministerially by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as needed, to reflect the actions set out in this order. (b) Imposition of Duty. (i) All postal items containing goods described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195 and sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong and transported by carriers that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall be subject to the duties described in subsection (c) of this section. In order to address the threat of the PRC’s failure to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids into the United States, while allowing for the orderly flow of legitimate international mail, the duties imposed in subsection (c) of this section, except as required by applicable law, are imposed in lieu of any other duties that the shipments would otherwise be subject to, including the 20 percent ad valorem duty established in Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228; most-favored nation rates embodied in the HTSUS; and duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. (ii) CBP is authorized to require the carrier transporting the international postal package into the United States to remit payment of the duty described in subsection (c) of this section to CBP monthly or on such other periodic time frame as CBP determines appropriate, and CBP may issue regulations and guidance as necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce this requirement. (iii) All carriers that transport international postal packages from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States as part of or on behalf of the international postal network must report to CBP the total number of postal items containing goods and, if electing the duty rate specified in subsection (c)(i) of this section, the value of each postal item containing goods, transported per conveyance, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by CBP. CBP may require submission of documentation and information from the carrier to verify the total number and value of individual postal items containing goods to be electronically transmitted through the ACE. (c) Duty Rates. Transportation carriers delivering shipments to the United States from the PRC or Hong Kong sent through the international postal network must collect and remit duties to CBP under the approach outlined in either subsection (c)(i) or subsection (c)(ii) of this section. Transportation carriers must apply the same duty collection methodology to all shipments; however, transportation carriers may change their collection methodology once a month or on such other periodic timeframe as CBP determines appropriate, upon providing 24-hour notice to CBP. (i) Ad Valorem Duty. 30 percent of the value of the postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025. (ii) Specific Duty. 25 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, and 50 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025. (d) Bond Requirement. Any carrier that transports international postal items containing goods from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States, by any mode of transportation, must have an international carrier bond to ensure payment of the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. CBP is authorized to ensure that the international carrier bonds required by this subsection are sufficient to account for the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. (e) Discretion to Require Formal Entry. CBP may require formal entry, in accordance with existing regulations, for any international postal package that may otherwise be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. An international postal package for which CBP requires formal entry will not be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and instead will be subject to all applicable duties, taxes, and fees in accordance with all applicable laws. Sec . 3 . Implementation of Duty . The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to take all necessary actions to implement this order. Consistent with section 4 of Executive Order 14195, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec . 4 . Homeland Security Authorities . Nothing in this order limits the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to use any available legal authorities granted to ensure compliance with the provisions of this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President regarding the impact of this order on American industries, consumers, and supply chains and making recommendations for further action as he deems necessary, including a recommendation on whether extending de minimis ineligibility to packages from Macau is necessary to prevent circumvention of this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Their proud perseverance in overcoming tremendous hurdles is emblematic of the strength and grit that makes America great. The First Lady and I extend our heartfelt appreciation to the families, friends, and communities aiding Americans with ASD as we empower every citizen to take part in and shape our new golden age. Autism now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, a staggering increase from the 1980s, when the disorder was found in only 1 to 4 out of every 10,000 individuals. I created the Make America Healthy Again Commission to investigate and address the root causes of our escalating health crisis, with a focus on childhood disorders like autism. As part of this effort, my Administration is prioritizing gold-standard research and increasing transparency to gain new insights to aid those with ASD. Under my leadership, our great Nation will be stronger than ever before, with opportunities for all Americans to thrive and prosper. Despite challenges, Americans with ASD have made, and will continue to make outstanding contributions for our country and the world. Early detection is crucial to improving the quality of life of those with ASD, as timely intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes. Identifying signs of autism at the onset allows parents and healthcare providers to implement therapies and support strategies which can enhance communication and social skills. Loving parents want the best for their children in educational environments and so do we. By supporting our children and their families, we can help them in overcoming challenges during childhood, the most crucial stage of development. Together, on World Autism Awareness Day, we declare our unending support and wholehearted respect for Americans living with autism. My Administration will empower them to reach their full potential and realize their American Dream. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2025, as World Autism Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by individuals with autism, and find ways to support those with autism and their families.

Purpose . In order to secure America&#8217;s economic prosperity and national security, lower the cost of living, and provide for increases in electrical demand from emerging technologies, we must increase domestic energy production, including coal. Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America&#8217;s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness. Our Nation&#8217;s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our Nation&#8217;s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security. It is a national priority to support the domestic coal industry by removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation. Sec . 3 . Strengthening Our National Energy Security . The Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) shall designate coal as a &#8220;mineral&#8221; as defined in section 2 of Executive Order 14241 of March 20, 2025 (Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production), thereby entitling coal to all the benefits of a &#8220;mineral&#8221; under that order. Further, Executive Order 14241 is hereby amended by deleting the reference to &#8220;4332(d)(1)(B)&#8221; in section 6(d) of that order and replacing it with a reference to &#8220;4532(d)(1)(B)&#8221;. Sec . 4 . Assessing Coal Resources and Accessibility on Federal Lands . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Energy shall submit a consolidated report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that identifies coal resources and reserves on Federal lands, assesses impediments to mining such coal resources, and proposes policies to address such impediments and ultimately enable the mining of such coal resources by either private or public actors. (b) The Secretary of Energy shall include in the report described in subsection (a) of this section an analysis of the impact that the availability of the coal resources identified could have on electricity costs and grid reliability. Sec. 5. Lifting Barriers to Coal Mining on Federal Lands. (a) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall prioritize coal leasing and related activities, consistent with applicable law, as the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources identified in the report described in section 4(a) of this order and expedite coal leasing in these areas, including by utilizing such emergency authorities as are available to them and identifying opportunities to provide for expedited environmental reviews, consistent with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authorities in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 351-359), and the Multiple Mineral Development Act of 1954 (30 U.S.C. 521-531 et seq.), shall acknowledge the end of the Jewell Moratorium by ordering the publication of a notice in the Federal Register terminating the &#8220;Environmental Impact Statement Analyzing the Potential Environmental Effects from Maintaining Secretary Jewell&#8217;s Coal Leasing Moratorium&#8221;, and process royalty rate reduction applications from Federal coal lessees in as expeditious a manner as permitted by applicable law. Sec . 6 . Supporting American Coal as an Energy Source . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall identify any guidance, regulations, programs, and policies within their respective executive department or agency that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production and electricity generation. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall consider revising or rescinding Federal actions identified in subsection (a) of this section consistent with applicable law. (c) Agencies that are empowered to make loans, loan guarantees, grants, equity investments, or to conclude offtake agreements, both domestically and abroad, shall, to the extent permitted by law, take steps to rescind any policies or regulations seeking to or that actually discourage investment in coal production and coal-fired electricity generation, such as the 2021 U.S. Treasury Fossil Fuel Energy Guidance for Multilateral Development Banks rescinded by the Department of the Treasury and similar policies or regulations. (d) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, the Chief Executive Officer of the International Development Finance Corporation, the President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and the heads of all other agencies that have discretionary programs that provide, facilitate, or advocate for financing of energy projects shall review their charters, regulations, guidance, policies, international agreements, analytical models and internal bureaucratic processes to ensure that such materials do not discourage the agency from financing coal mining projects and electricity generation projects. Consistent with law, and subject to the applicable agency head&#8217;s discretion, where appropriate, any identified preferences against coal use shall immediately be eliminated except as explicitly provided for in statute. Sec . 7 . Supporting American Coal Exports . The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to promote and identify export opportunities for coal and coal technologies and facilitate international offtake agreements for United States coal. Sec . 8 . Expanding Use of Categorical Exclusions for Coal Under the National Environmental Policy Act . Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall identify to the Council on Environmental Quality any existing and potential categorical exclusions pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, increased reliance on and adoption of which by other agencies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4336c could further the production and export of coal. Sec . 9 . Steel Dominance . (a) The Secretary of Energy, pursuant to the authority under the Energy Act of 2020 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), shall determine whether coal used in the production of steel meets the definition of a &#8220;critical material&#8221; under the Act and, if so, shall take steps to place it on the Department of Energy Critical Materials List. (b) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authority under the Act, shall determine whether metallurgical coal used in the production of steel meets the criteria to be designated as a &#8220;critical mineral&#8221; under the Act and, if so, shall take steps to place coal on the Department of the Interior Critical Minerals List. Sec . 10 . Powering Artificial Intelligence Data Centers . (a) For the purposes of this order, &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; or &#8220;AI&#8221; has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3). (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Energy shall identify regions where coal-powered infrastructure is available and suitable for supporting AI data centers; assess the market, legal, and technological potential for expanding coal-based infrastructure to power data centers to meet the electricity needs of AI and high-performance computing operations; and submit a consolidated summary report with their findings and proposals to the Chair of the NEDC, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto. Sec . 11 . Acceleration of Coal Technology . (a) The Secretary of Energy shall take all necessary actions, consistent with applicable law, to accelerate the development, deployment, and commercialization of coal technologies including, but not limited to, utilizing all available funding mechanisms to support the expansion of coal technology, including technologies that utilize coal and coal byproducts such as building materials, battery materials, carbon fiber, synthetic graphite, and printing materials, as well as updating coal feedstock for power generation and steelmaking. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall submit a detailed action plan to the President through the Chair of the NEDC outlining the funding mechanisms, programs, and policy actions taken to accelerate coal technology deployment.

Purpose . In order to secure America’s economic prosperity and national security, lower the cost of living, and provide for increases in electrical demand from emerging technologies, we must increase domestic energy production, including coal. Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness. Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security. It is a national priority to support the domestic coal industry by removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation. Sec . 3 . Strengthening Our National Energy Security . The Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) shall designate coal as a “mineral” as defined in section 2 of Executive Order 14241 of March 20, 2025 (Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production), thereby entitling coal to all the benefits of a “mineral” under that order. Further, Executive Order 14241 is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “4332(d)(1)(B)” in section 6(d) of that order and replacing it with a reference to “4532(d)(1)(B)”. Sec . 4 . Assessing Coal Resources and Accessibility on Federal Lands . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Energy shall submit a consolidated report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that identifies coal resources and reserves on Federal lands, assesses impediments to mining such coal resources, and proposes policies to address such impediments and ultimately enable the mining of such coal resources by either private or public actors. (b) The Secretary of Energy shall include in the report described in subsection (a) of this section an analysis of the impact that the availability of the coal resources identified could have on electricity costs and grid reliability. Sec. 5. Lifting Barriers to Coal Mining on Federal Lands. (a) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall prioritize coal leasing and related activities, consistent with applicable law, as the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources identified in the report described in section 4(a) of this order and expedite coal leasing in these areas, including by utilizing such emergency authorities as are available to them and identifying opportunities to provide for expedited environmental reviews, consistent with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authorities in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 351-359), and the Multiple Mineral Development Act of 1954 (30 U.S.C. 521-531 et seq.), shall acknowledge the end of the Jewell Moratorium by ordering the publication of a notice in the Federal Register terminating the “Environmental Impact Statement Analyzing the Potential Environmental Effects from Maintaining Secretary Jewell’s Coal Leasing Moratorium”, and process royalty rate reduction applications from Federal coal lessees in as expeditious a manner as permitted by applicable law. Sec . 6 . Supporting American Coal as an Energy Source . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall identify any guidance, regulations, programs, and policies within their respective executive department or agency that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production and electricity generation. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall consider revising or rescinding Federal actions identified in subsection (a) of this section consistent with applicable law. (c) Agencies that are empowered to make loans, loan guarantees, grants, equity investments, or to conclude offtake agreements, both domestically and abroad, shall, to the extent permitted by law, take steps to rescind any policies or regulations seeking to or that actually discourage investment in coal production and coal-fired electricity generation, such as the 2021 U.S. Treasury Fossil Fuel Energy Guidance for Multilateral Development Banks rescinded by the Department of the Treasury and similar policies or regulations. (d) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, the Chief Executive Officer of the International Development Finance Corporation, the President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and the heads of all other agencies that have discretionary programs that provide, facilitate, or advocate for financing of energy projects shall review their charters, regulations, guidance, policies, international agreements, analytical models and internal bureaucratic processes to ensure that such materials do not discourage the agency from financing coal mining projects and electricity generation projects. Consistent with law, and subject to the applicable agency head’s discretion, where appropriate, any identified preferences against coal use shall immediately be eliminated except as explicitly provided for in statute. Sec . 7 . Supporting American Coal Exports . The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to promote and identify export opportunities for coal and coal technologies and facilitate international offtake agreements for United States coal. Sec . 8 . Expanding Use of Categorical Exclusions for Coal Under the National Environmental Policy Act . Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall identify to the Council on Environmental Quality any existing and potential categorical exclusions pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, increased reliance on and adoption of which by other agencies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4336c could further the production and export of coal. Sec . 9 . Steel Dominance . (a) The Secretary of Energy, pursuant to the authority under the Energy Act of 2020 (the “Act”), shall determine whether coal used in the production of steel meets the definition of a “critical material” under the Act and, if so, shall take steps to place it on the Department of Energy Critical Materials List. (b) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authority under the Act, shall determine whether metallurgical coal used in the production of steel meets the criteria to be designated as a “critical mineral” under the Act and, if so, shall take steps to place coal on the Department of the Interior Critical Minerals List. Sec . 10 . Powering Artificial Intelligence Data Centers . (a) For the purposes of this order, “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3). (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Energy shall identify regions where coal-powered infrastructure is available and suitable for supporting AI data centers; assess the market, legal, and technological potential for expanding coal-based infrastructure to power data centers to meet the electricity needs of AI and high-performance computing operations; and submit a consolidated summary report with their findings and proposals to the Chair of the NEDC, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto. Sec . 11 . Acceleration of Coal Technology . (a) The Secretary of Energy shall take all necessary actions, consistent with applicable law, to accelerate the development, deployment, and commercialization of coal technologies including, but not limited to, utilizing all available funding mechanisms to support the expansion of coal technology, including technologies that utilize coal and coal byproducts such as building materials, battery materials, carbon fiber, synthetic graphite, and printing materials, as well as updating coal feedstock for power generation and steelmaking. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall submit a detailed action plan to the President through the Chair of the NEDC outlining the funding mechanisms, programs, and policy actions taken to accelerate coal technology deployment. Sec . 12 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed &#8220;resistance&#8221; within the Federal Government that &#8220;vowed&#8221; to undermine and render ineffective a sitting President. He illegally published classified conversations to sell his book under the pseudonym &#8220;Anonymous,&#8221; which is full of falsehoods and fabricated stories. In so doing, Taylor abandoned his sacred oath and commitment to public service by disclosing sensitive information obtained through unauthorized methods and betrayed the confidence of those with whom he served. Where a Government employee improperly discloses sensitive information for the purposes of personal enrichment and undermining our foreign policy, national security, and Government effectiveness –- all ultimately designed to sow chaos and distrust in Government &#8212; this conduct could properly be characterized as treasonous and as possibly violating the Espionage Act, and therefore makes such employee ineligible for access to national secrets. In his former position, Taylor relied upon various colleagues to facilitate his unethical laundering and release of sensitive Government data to advance his false narratives. It is therefore against America&#8217;s interests to allow those associated with Taylor to access our Nation&#8217;s secrets. Accordingly, I direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant executive department and agency (agency) heads to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by Miles Taylor, in addition to individuals at entities associated with Taylor, including the University of Pennsylvania, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other relevant agency heads, to take all appropriate action to review Miles Taylor&#8217;s activities as a Government employee. This review should identify any instances where his conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, and where his conduct appears to have involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information. Upon completing this review, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to protect America&#8217;s interests.

Yet in recent years, elitist leaders in Government have unlawfully censored speech and weaponized their undeserved influence to silence perceived political opponents and advance their preferred, and often erroneous, narrative about significant matters of public debate. These disgraceful actions have taken the form of coercive threats against the private sector &#8212; including major social media platforms &#8212; to suppress conservative or dissenting voices and distort public opinion. Much of this censorship took place during a Presidential election with the apparent purpose of undermining the free exchange of ideas and debate. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. Krebs&#8217; misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic. CISA, under Krebs&#8217; leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. CISA covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop. Krebs, through CISA, promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. Krebs skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA&#8217;s favored perspective. Abusive conduct of this sort both violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs. I further direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. I further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review Krebs&#8217; activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA. This review should identify any instances where Krebs&#8217; conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA&#8217;s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA&#8217;s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA’s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . As Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, I am committed to ensuring that the United States military possesses the most lethal warfighting capabilities in the world. America&#8217;s defense industrial base is central to this effort. Similarly, the defense acquisition workforce is a national strategic asset that will be decisive in any conflict, where the factory floor can be just as significant as the battlefield. Unfortunately, after years of misplaced priorities and poor management, our defense acquisition system does not provide the speed and flexibility our Armed Forces need to have decisive advantages in the future. In order to strengthen our military edge, America must deliver state‐of‐the‐art capabilities at speed and scale through a comprehensive overhaul of this system. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States Government to accelerate defense procurement and revitalize the defense industrial base to restore peace through strength. To achieve this, the United States will rapidly reform our antiquated defense acquisition processes with an emphasis on speed, flexibility, and execution. We will also modernize the duties and composition of the defense acquisition workforce, as well as incentivize and reward risk-taking and innovation from these personnel. Sec . 3 . Acquisition Process Reform . Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President a plan to reform the Department of Defense&#8217;s acquisition processes that, to the maximum extent possible, incorporates the following: (a) Utilization of existing authorities to expedite acquisitions throughout the Department of Defense, including a first preference for commercial solutions and a general preference for Other Transactions Authority, application of Rapid Capabilities Office policies, or any other authorities or pathways to promote streamlined acquisitions under the Adaptative Acquisition Framework. Starting upon issuance of this order, and during the formation of the plan, the Secretary of Defense shall prioritize use of these authorities in all pending Department of Defense contracting actions and require their application, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law, for all Department of Defense contracting actions pursued while the plan directed by this section is under consideration. (b) A detailed process review of each functional support role within the acquisition workforce to eliminate unnecessary tasks, reduce duplicative approvals, and centralize decision-making. These reviews should also include evaluations of program managers, contracting officers, engineering authorities, financial managers, cost estimators, and logisticians. (c) A detailed process by which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Service Acquisition Executives, and Component Acquisition Executives can effectively manage risk for all acquisition programs through a formal steering board known as a Configuration Steering Board. Sec . 4 . Internal Regulations Review . The Secretary of Defense shall oversee the review of and, as appropriate, propose revisions to relevant Department of Defense instructions, implementation guides, manuals, and regulations relating to acquisition to: (a) Eliminate or revise any unnecessary supplemental regulations or any other internal guidance, such as relevant parts of the Financial Management Regulation and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. (b) Promote expedited and streamlined acquisitions. Where new supplemental regulations or internal guidance is proposed, the Secretary of Defense shall apply the ten-for-one rule as described in Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation). Sec . 5 . Acquisition Workforce Reform . Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and Component Acquisition Executives, shall develop and submit to the President a plan for consideration to reform, right-size, and train the acquisition workforce that includes the following components: (a) The restructuring of performance evaluation metrics for acquisition workforce members to include the ability to demonstrate and apply a first consideration of commercial solutions, adaptive acquisition pathways through the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, and iterative requirements based on the perspective of the end user. (b) An analysis of acquisition workforce staff levels required to develop, deliver, and sustain warfighting capabilities. (c) The establishment of field training teams by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, led by senior acquisition executives or managers with expertise in innovative acquisition authorities and commercial solutions, and modeled after field training teams authorized by section 832 of Public Law 118-159 (10 U.S.C. 1749). These teams should provide hands-on guidance, deliver templates and case studies of successful approaches for implementing innovative acquisition authorities, and should assist integrated functional program teams in completing acquisition and sustainment tasks. (d) The development and implementation of policies, procedures, and tools to incentivize acquisition officials to, in good faith, utilize innovative acquisition authorities and take measured and calculated risks. Sec . 6 . Major Defense Acquisition Program Review . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, and Component Acquisition Executives, shall complete a comprehensive review of all major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs), as defined in section 4201 of title 10, United States Code, to determine if any such programs are inconsistent with the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. As part of the review of all MDAPs: (i) any program more than 15 percent behind schedule based on the current Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), 15 percent over cost based on the current APB, unable to meet any key performance parameters, or unaligned with the Secretary of Defense&#8217;s mission priorities, will be considered for potential cancellation. The Secretary of Defense shall submit the potential cancellation list to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for future budget determinations. (ii) the Secretary of Defense shall provide a listing of all MDAPs contracts, along with performance against original and approved Government cost estimates to the Director of OMB for review within 90 days from the date of this order. (b) Following this comprehensive review of MDAPs, the Secretary of Defense shall provide the Director of OMB with a plan for reviewing all remaining major systems, as defined in section 3041 of title 10, United States Code, that are not MDAPs. Sec . 7 . Requirements . The Secretary of Defense, acting through the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall complete a comprehensive review of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System within 180 days of the date of this order, with the goal of streamlining and accelerating acquisition. Sec . 8 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a) The term &#8220;Adaptive Acquisition Framework&#8221; means the series of acquisition pathways that enable the workforce to deliver &#8220;effective, suitable, survivable, sustainable, and affordable solutions to the end user in a timely manner,&#8221; as stated in Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02. (b) The term &#8220;Acquisition Program Baseline&#8221; means the formally established cost, schedule, and performance baselines of a program, as described in Department of Defense Instruction 5000.85. (c) The term &#8220;commercial solutions&#8221; means any of the methods for procurement of a commercial product or service described in part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, subpart 212.2 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, or subpart 212.70 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; or other industry solutions funded by private investment that meet military needs. (d) The term &#8220;Configuration Steering Board&#8221; means an annual review of potential requirements changes, critical intelligence parameter changes, and any significant technical configuration changes as described in Department of Defense Instruction 5000.85. (e) The term &#8220;innovative acquisition authorities&#8221; means Other Transactions Authority, commercial solutions, application of Rapid Capabilities Office policies, or any other authorities or pathways to promote streamlined acquisitions under the Adaptive Acquisition Framework. (f) The term &#8220;Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System&#8221; means the formally established Department of Defense process used to identify, assess, and prioritize joint military capability requirements across the Department of Defense. (g) The term &#8220;Other Transactions Authority&#8221; means the ability of the United States Government to enter into contracts other than standard contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements. (h) The term &#8220;Rapid Capabilities Office&#8221; means the Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, Naval Air Warfare Rapid Capabilities Office, Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, or Space Force Rapid Capabilities Office. Sec . 9 . General Provisions .

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . The commercial shipbuilding capacity and maritime workforce of the United States has been weakened by decades of Government neglect, leading to the decline of a once strong industrial base while simultaneously empowering our adversaries and eroding United States national security. Both our allies and our strategic competitors produce ships for a fraction of the cost needed in the United States. Recent data shows that the United States constructs less than one percent of commercial ships globally, while the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) is responsible for producing approximately half. Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable Federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America&#8217;s maritime manufacturing capabilities (the Maritime Industrial Base), and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. Sec . 3 . Maritime Action Plan . (a) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) the APNSA deems appropriate, shall submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to the President, through the APNSA and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) to achieve the policy set forth in this order. (b) The OMB Director, in coordination with the APNSA, shall be responsible for all legislative, regulatory, and fiscal assessments related to the MAP. (c) The MAP shall, to the extent permissible and consistent with applicable law, including the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305), reflect actions taken pursuant to sections 4 through 21 of this order. Sec . 4 . Ensure the Security and Resilience of the Maritime Industrial Base . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the MAP an assessment of options both for the use of available authorities and resources, such as Defense Production Act Title III authorities, and for the use of private capital to the maximum extent possible to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial Base including, but not limited to, investment and expansion of commercial and defense shipbuilding capabilities, component supply chains, ship repair and marine transportation capabilities, port infrastructure, and the adjacent workforce.

Purpose . The commercial shipbuilding capacity and maritime workforce of the United States has been weakened by decades of Government neglect, leading to the decline of a once strong industrial base while simultaneously empowering our adversaries and eroding United States national security. Both our allies and our strategic competitors produce ships for a fraction of the cost needed in the United States. Recent data shows that the United States constructs less than one percent of commercial ships globally, while the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is responsible for producing approximately half. Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable Federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing capabilities (the Maritime Industrial Base), and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. Sec . 3 . Maritime Action Plan . (a) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) the APNSA deems appropriate, shall submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to the President, through the APNSA and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) to achieve the policy set forth in this order. (b) The OMB Director, in coordination with the APNSA, shall be responsible for all legislative, regulatory, and fiscal assessments related to the MAP. (c) The MAP shall, to the extent permissible and consistent with applicable law, including the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305), reflect actions taken pursuant to sections 4 through 21 of this order. Sec . 4 . Ensure the Security and Resilience of the Maritime Industrial Base . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the MAP an assessment of options both for the use of available authorities and resources, such as Defense Production Act Title III authorities, and for the use of private capital to the maximum extent possible to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial Base including, but not limited to, investment and expansion of commercial and defense shipbuilding capabilities, component supply chains, ship repair and marine transportation capabilities, port infrastructure, and the adjacent workforce. The Secretary of Defense shall pursue using the Office of Strategic Capital loan program to improve the shipbuilding industrial base. As part of their assessment, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall: (a) identify key maritime components in the supply chain that are essential for rebuilding and expanding the Maritime Industrial Base and that should be prioritized for investment; (b) ensure that their recommendations of public and private investments are made according to a clear metric, derived in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, of return on invested capital for the United States taxpayer and to the economic and national security of the United States; and (c) ensure that their recommendations take into consideration the projected increases to commercial and defense capabilities, the projected growth in economic activity, and the projected benefits for taxpayers and the workforce.

Consistent with these priorities and with my commitment to restore fidelity to the Constitution, on February 19, 2025, I&nbsp;issued Executive Order 14219 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; Deregulatory Initiative ) .&nbsp; It directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to identify certain categories of unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations within 60 days and begin plans to repeal them.&nbsp; This review-and-repeal effort shall prioritize, in particular, evaluating each existing regulation&#8217;s lawfulness under the following United&nbsp;States Supreme Court decisions:&nbsp; Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , 603 U.S. 369 (2024); West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697 (2022); SEC v. Jarkesy , 603 U.S. 109 (2024); Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743 (2015); Sackett v. EPA , 598 U.S. 651 (2023); Ohio v.

Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 U.S. 14 (2020). In effectuating repeals of facially unlawful regulations, agency heads shall finalize rules without notice and comment, where doing so is consistent with the &#8220;good cause&#8221; exception in the Administrative Procedure Act. That exception allows agencies to dispense with notice-and-comment rulemaking when that process would be &#8220;impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.&#8221; Retaining and enforcing facially unlawful regulations is clearly contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, notice-and-comment proceedings are &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; where repeal is required as a matter of law to ensure consistency with a ruling of the United States Supreme Court. Agencies thus have ample cause and the legal authority to immediately repeal unlawful regulations. Accordingly, I hereby direct: Following the 60-day review period ordered in Executive Order 14219 to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, agencies shall immediately take steps to effectuate the repeal of any regulation, or the portion of any regulation, that clearly exceeds the agency&#8217;s statutory authority or is otherwise unlawful. Agencies should give priority to the regulations in conflict with the United States Supreme Court decisions listed earlier in this memorandum. The repeal of each unlawful regulation shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons that the &#8220;good cause&#8221; exception applies. Within 30 days of the conclusion of the review period directed in Executive Order 14219 to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, agencies shall submit to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs a one-page summary of each regulation that was initially identified as falling within one of the categories specified in section 2(a) of that Executive Order, but which has not been targeted for repeal, explaining the basis for the decision not to repeal that regulation.

Our southern border is under attack from a variety of threats. The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past. Through Executive Order 14167 of January 20, 2025 (Clarifying the Military&#8217;s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States), I assigned the Armed Forces of the United States the military missions of repelling the invasion and sealing the United States southern border from unlawful entry to maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States. This memorandum provides additional guidance on securing the southern border to the heads of certain executive departments. Section 1 . Policy . (a) to accomplish the military missions described in Executive Order 14167, and to ensure the safety and security of the military and other Federal personnel in areas of military operations within Federal lands along the southern border, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions: (i) to provide for the use and jurisdiction by the Department of Defense over such Federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation and excluding Federal Indian Reservations, that are reasonably necessary to enable military activities directed in this memorandum, including border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment; and (ii) to provide for transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over such Federal lands in accordance with applicable law to enable military activities directed in this memorandum to occur on a military installation under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and for the designation of such Federal lands as National Defense Areas by the Secretary of Defense. (b) The Secretary of the Interior shall allow the Secretary of Defense to use those portions of the Roosevelt Reservation not yet transferred or withdrawn under this memorandum. In accordance with Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), 43 U.S.C. 155 is hereby invoked and the Secretary of the Interior may make withdrawals, reservations, and restrictions of public lands to provide for the utilization of public lands by the Department of Defense to address the emergency at the southern border, without regard to any limitation on withdrawals otherwise applicable under the terms of the Engle Act, 43 U.S.C. 155-158. (c) The Secretary of Defense may determine those military activities that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission assigned in Executive Order 14167 and that are necessary to protect and maintain the security of military installations, consistent with section 2672 of title 10, United States Code, and the longstanding authority of a military installation commander to exclude persons from a military installation, as recognized in section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797) and 18 U.S.C. 1382. (d) In carrying out activities under this memorandum, members of the Armed Forces will follow rules for the use of force prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Sec . 2 . Phased Implementation . The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security will initially implement this memorandum on a limited sector of Federal lands designated by the Secretary of Defense. Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense shall assess this initial phase. At any time, the Secretary of Defense may extend activities under this memorandum to additional Federal lands along the southern border in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority of the Secretary of Defense to authorize and request that State Governors order members of the National Guard under authority of title 32 of the United States Code to conduct Department of Defense activities, including as appropriate to support law enforcement activities under the responsibility of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, if requested by such official; (ii) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (iii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Our southern border is under attack from a variety of threats. The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past. Through Executive Order 14167 of January 20, 2025 (Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States), I assigned the Armed Forces of the United States the military missions of repelling the invasion and sealing the United States southern border from unlawful entry to maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States. This memorandum provides additional guidance on securing the southern border to the heads of certain executive departments. Section 1 . Policy . (a) to accomplish the military missions described in Executive Order 14167, and to ensure the safety and security of the military and other Federal personnel in areas of military operations within Federal lands along the southern border, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions: (i) to provide for the use and jurisdiction by the Department of Defense over such Federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation and excluding Federal Indian Reservations, that are reasonably necessary to enable military activities directed in this memorandum, including border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment; and (ii) to provide for transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over such Federal lands in accordance with applicable law to enable military activities directed in this memorandum to occur on a military installation under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and for the designation of such Federal lands as National Defense Areas by the Secretary of Defense. (b) The Secretary of the Interior shall allow the Secretary of Defense to use those portions of the Roosevelt Reservation not yet transferred or withdrawn under this memorandum. In accordance with Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), 43 U.S.C. 155 is hereby invoked and the Secretary of the Interior may make withdrawals, reservations, and restrictions of public lands to provide for the utilization of public lands by the Department of Defense to address the emergency at the southern border, without regard to any limitation on withdrawals otherwise applicable under the terms of the Engle Act, 43 U.S.C. 155-158. (c) The Secretary of Defense may determine those military activities that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission assigned in Executive Order 14167 and that are necessary to protect and maintain the security of military installations, consistent with section 2672 of title 10, United States Code, and the longstanding authority of a military installation commander to exclude persons from a military installation, as recognized in section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797) and 18 U.S.C. 1382. (d) In carrying out activities under this memorandum, members of the Armed Forces will follow rules for the use of force prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Sec . 2 . Phased Implementation . The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security will initially implement this memorandum on a limited sector of Federal lands designated by the Secretary of Defense. Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense shall assess this initial phase. At any time, the Secretary of Defense may extend activities under this memorandum to additional Federal lands along the southern border in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority of the Secretary of Defense to authorize and request that State Governors order members of the National Guard under authority of title 32 of the United States Code to conduct Department of Defense activities, including as appropriate to support law enforcement activities under the responsibility of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, if requested by such official; (ii) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (iii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . My first term included numerous significant actions, including some of the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription drug prices to American patients. The message was clear: no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufacturers charged patients in our Nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places. These actions included encouraging the development of generic and biosimilar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and biologics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medicines. The United States also, for the first time, established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country. Reform efforts ensured that Government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen. New price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients, doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase. Insulin copayments were capped for Medicare beneficiaries, and manufacturers, instead of patients and taxpayers, were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts. I also called on the Congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the long-term. When the Congress refused, I proposed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad. Combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for American patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the United States and foreign nations over time. Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration reversed, walked back, or neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for American patients. The Biden Administration then signed into law the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which included the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Program. While this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices Medicare and its beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than projected. Further, accompanying changes to the Medicare Part D program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering Part D plans. Finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products. Known as the &#8220;pill penalty,&#8221; this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products, which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations. The American people deserve better. It is time to restore the progress our Nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting Americans first and making America healthy again. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that Federal health care programs, intellectual property protections, and safety regulations are optimized to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to American patients and taxpayers. Sec . 3 . Improving upon the Inflation Reduction Act . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), consistent with sections 1191 to 1198 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320f-1320f-7) and other applicable law, shall propose and seek comment on guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2028 and manufacturer effectuation of maximum fair price under such program in 2026, 2027, and 2028. The guidance shall improve the transparency of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs to the Medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the United States. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall provide recommendations to the President on how best to stabilize and reduce Medicare Part D premiums. (c) The Secretary shall work with the Congress to modify the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program to align the treatment of small molecule prescription drugs with that of biological products, ending the distortion that undermines relative investment in small molecule prescription drugs, coupled with other reforms to prevent any increase in overall costs to Medicare and its beneficiaries. Sec . 4 . Reducing the Prices of High-Cost Drugs for Seniors . Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and implement a rulemaking plan and select for testing, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), a payment model to improve the ability of the Medicare program to obtain better value for high-cost prescription drugs and biological products covered by Medicare, including those not subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. Sec . 5 . Appropriately Accounting for Acquisition Costs of Drugs in Medicare . Within 180 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a plan to conduct a survey under section 1833(t)(14)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act to determine the hospital acquisition cost for covered outpatient drugs at hospital outpatient departments. Following the conclusion of this survey, the Secretary shall consider and propose any appropriate adjustments that would align Medicare payment with the cost of acquisition, consistent with the budget neutrality requirement in section 1833(t)(9)(B) of the Social Security Act and other legal requirements. Sec . 6 . Promoting Innovation, Value, and Enhanced Oversight in Medicaid Drug Payment . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, shall jointly provide recommendations to the President on how best to ensure that manufacturers pay accurate Medicaid drug rebates consistent with section 1927 of the Social Security Act, promote innovation in Medicaid drug payment methodologies, link payments for drugs to the value obtained, and support States in managing drug spending. Sec . 7 . Access to Affordable Life-Saving Medications . Within 90 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary shall take action to ensure future grants available under section 330(e) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), are conditioned upon health centers establishing practices to make insulin and injectable epinephrine available at or below the discounted price paid by the health center grantee or sub-grantee under the 340B Prescription Drug Program (plus a minimal administration fee) to individuals with low incomes, as determined by the Secretary, who: (a) have a high cost-sharing requirement for either insulin or injectable epinephrine; (b) have a high unmet deductible; or (c) have no healthcare insurance. Sec . 8 . Reevaluating the Role of Middlemen . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, the OMB Director, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall provide recommendations to the President on how best to promote a more competitive, efficient, transparent, and resilient pharmaceutical value chain that delivers lower drug prices for Americans. Sec . 9 . Accelerating Competition for High-Cost Prescription Drugs . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall issue a report providing administrative and legislative recommendations to: (a) accelerate approval of generics, biosimilars, combination products, and second-in-class brand name medications; and (b) improve the process through which prescription drugs can be reclassified as over-the-counter medications, including recommendations to optimally identify prescription drugs that can be safely provided to patients over the counter. Sec . 10 . Increasing Prescription Drug Importation to Lower Prices . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall take steps to streamline and improve the Importation Program under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make it easier for States to obtain approval without sacrificing safety or quality. Sec . 11 . Reducing Costly Care for Seniors . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall evaluate and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, propose regulations to ensure that payment within the Medicare program is not encouraging a shift in drug administration volume away from less costly physician office settings to more expensive hospital outpatient departments. Sec . 12 . Improving Transparency into Pharmacy Benefit Manager Fee Disclosure . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor shall propose regulations pursuant to section 408(b)(2)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to improve employer health plan fiduciary transparency into the direct and indirect compensation received by pharmacy benefit managers. Sec . 13 . Combating Anti-Competitive Behavior by Prescription Drug Manufacturers . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary or his designee shall conduct joint public listening sessions with the appropriate personnel from the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Federal Trade Commission and issue a report with recommendations to reduce anti-competitive behavior from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Sec . 14 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i.) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Responsibility for Determining Eligibility for Public Benefits . (a) As set forth in Executive Order 14218 of February 19, 2025 (Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders), both Federal law (title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)) and principles of sound administration demand that taxpayer-funded benefits be provided only to eligible persons and not encourage or reward illegal immigration to the United States. This interest is especially compelling with respect to Social Security Act benefits, which demand strict policing of fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure future eligible individuals receive the benefits to which they are entitled. Consequently, this memorandum gives additional direction for implementing Executive Order 14218 with regard to Social Security Act programs. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security as necessary, shall take all reasonable measures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure ineligible aliens are not receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.&nbsp; Such measures shall include promulgating any necessary guidance or regulations regarding Social Security Act funds and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with law, prioritizing civil or administrative enforcement actions against States, localities, or other similar grantees or subgrantees that do not take adequate measures to verify eligibility, stop payments to deceased or otherwise ineligible payees, or otherwise prevent ineligible aliens from receiving funds from Social Security Act programs. (c) The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Social Security shall cooperate to detail and credential such Special Assistant United States Attorneys as are necessary to expand the Social Security Administration&#8217;s (SSA) full-time fraud prosecutor program to at least 50 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025. Likewise, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate to establish a similar fraud-prosecutor program utilizing Special Assistant United States Attorneys with regard to programs administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which shall operate in at least 15 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025. Detailees in both programs shall emphasize prosecutions of identity theft and beneficiary-side fraud. To the extent feasible, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Commissioner of Social Security, as applicable, shall prioritize assigning new detailees in both programs to the 10 United States Attorney Offices whose jurisdictions encompass the largest known populations of illegal aliens, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. (d)&nbsp; The risk of beneficiary- or recipient-side fraud and abuse by illegal aliens shall also be reduced through other program-integrity measures. (i) The Inspector General of the SSA noted in a July 2023 audit that death information regarding millions of deceased number holders is missing from the agency&#8217;s files, which obstructs efforts to prevent and detect fraud and improper payments across the Government with respect to executive departments and agencies that rely on SSA&#8217;s information. The Commissioner of Social Security shall fully implement the recommendations in the Inspector General of the SSA&#8217;s Audit Report A-06-21-51022. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate fully with such implementation. (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same audit report revealed that the SSA does not investigate or attempt to resolve reports of earnings received by individuals age 100 or older if the SSA has not recorded death information for such individuals, even when the reported wage-earner does not match the name or other personally identifiable information in SSA records, which may indicate identity theft, illegal work, tax evasion, or other unlawful activity.&nbsp; The Commissioner of Social Security shall refer promptly to the Inspector General of the SSA all earnings reports for persons age 100 or older when the purported wage-earner&#8217;s name does not match SSA&#8217;s files. &nbsp;The Inspector General of the SSA shall investigate such matters as appropriate and refer matters to the Department of Justice, other executive departments and agencies, or local prosecutors as warranted. (iii)&nbsp; Finally, within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Commissioner of Social Security shall review whether, and under what conditions, SSA should resume pursuing civil monetary penalties under section 1129 of the Social Security Act.&nbsp; If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that resumption is warranted, he shall either resume such program immediately or pursue regulatory or policy changes that would allow its resumption in a timely manner. Sec . 2 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Background . Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the modern world, driving innovation across industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the way we live and work. To ensure the United States remains a global leader in this technological revolution, we must provide our Nation&#8217;s youth with opportunities to cultivate the skills and understanding necessary to use and create the next generation of AI technology. By fostering AI competency, we will equip our students with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to adapt to and thrive in an increasingly digital society. Early learning and exposure to AI concepts not only demystifies this powerful technology but also sparks curiosity and creativity, preparing students to become active and responsible participants in the workforce of the future and nurturing the next generation of American AI innovators to propel our Nation to new heights of scientific and economic achievement. To achieve this vision, we must also invest in our educators and equip them with the tools and knowledge to not only train students about AI, but also to utilize AI in their classrooms to improve educational outcomes. Professional development programs focused on AI education will empower educators to confidently guide students through this complex and evolving field. Educators, industry leaders, and employers who rely on an AI-skilled workforce should partner to create educational programs that equip students with essential AI skills and competencies across all learning pathways. While AI education in kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) is critical, our Nation must also make resources available for lifelong learners to develop new skills for a changing workforce. By establishing a strong framework that integrates early student exposure with comprehensive teacher training and other resources for workforce development, we can ensure that every American has the opportunity to learn about AI from the earliest stages of their educational journey through postsecondary education, fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking that will solidify our Nation&#8217;s leadership in the AI-driven future. Sec . 2 . Policy .

(b) The Challenge shall feature multiple age categories, distinct geographic regions for competition, and a variety of topical themes of competition to reflect the breadth of AI applications, encouraging interdisciplinary exploration. (c) The Task Force and, as appropriate, agencies represented on the Task Force shall collaborate with relevant agencies and private sector entities to provide technical expertise, resources, and promotional support for implementing the Challenge, including through existing funding vehicles. Sec . 6 . Improving Education Through Artificial Intelligence .

The Task Force shall promptly announce such public-private partnerships on a rolling basis as they are formed. (i) The Task Force shall seek to utilize industry commitments and identify any Federal funding mechanisms, including discretionary grants, that can be used to provide resources for K-12 AI education.

(ii) The Task Force shall work to ensure the resources funded as described in subsection (i) of this section are ready for use in K-12 instruction within 180 days following the Task Force&#8217;s formal announcement of the first slate of public-private partnerships. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Task Force shall identify existing Federal AI resources on which agencies may rely, such as the NSF- and Department of Agriculture-sponsored National AI Research Institutes, to support partnerships with State and local educational agencies to improve AI education.

Purpose and Policy . Safe communities rely on the backbone and heroism of a tough and well-equipped police force. My Administration is steadfastly committed to empowering State and local law enforcement to firmly police dangerous criminal behavior and protect innocent citizens. When local leaders demonize law enforcement and impose legal and political handcuffs that make aggressively enforcing the law impossible, crime thrives and innocent citizens and small business owners suffer. My Administration will therefore: establish best practices at the State and local level for cities to unleash high-impact local police forces; protect and defend law enforcement officers wrongly accused and abused by State or local officials; and surge resources to officers in need. My Administration will work to ensure that law enforcement officers across America focus on ending crime, not pursuing harmful, illegal race- and sex-based &#8220;equity&#8221; policies. The result will be a law-abiding society in which tenacious law enforcement officers protect the innocent, violations of law are not tolerated, and American communities are safely enjoyed by all their citizens again. Sec . 2 . Legal Defense of Law Enforcement Officers . The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law. This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers. Sec . 3 . Empowering State and Local Law Enforcement . (a) The Attorney General and other appropriate heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to maximize the use of Federal resources to: (i) provide new best practices to State and local law enforcement to aggressively police communities against all crimes; (ii) expand access and improve the quality of training available to State and local law enforcement; (iii) increase pay and benefits for law enforcement officers; (iv) strengthen and expand legal protections for law enforcement officers; (v) seek enhanced sentences for crimes against law enforcement officers; (vi) promote investment in the security and capacity of prisons; and (vii) increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall review all ongoing Federal consent decrees, out-of-court agreements, and post-judgment orders to which a State or local law enforcement agency is a party and modify, rescind, or move to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions. Sec . 4 . Using National Security Assets for Law and Order . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of agencies as appropriate, shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime. Sec . 5 . Holding State and Local Officials Accountable . The Attorney General shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to enforce the rights of Americans impacted by crime and shall prioritize prosecution of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to State and local jurisdictions whose officials: (a) willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties necessary for public safety and law enforcement; or (b) unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights violations under the guise of &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; initiatives that restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens. Sec . 6 . Use of Homeland Security Task Forces . The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall utilize the Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) formed in accordance with Executive Order 14159 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the American People Against Invasion) to coordinate and advance the objectives of this order. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: i. the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or ii. the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose and Policy . Federal supremacy with respect to immigration, national security, and foreign policy is axiomatic. The Constitution provides the Federal Government with plenary authority regarding immigration to protect the sovereignty of our Nation and to conduct relations with other nations, who must be able to deal with one national Government on such matters. This power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions: Article II of the Constitution vests the power to protect national security and conduct foreign policy in the President of the United States, and Article IV, Section 4, requires the Federal Government to &#8220;protect each of [the States] against Invasion.&#8221; This Federal power over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty. The prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to illegally enter the United States. The resulting public safety and national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of, and control of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal organizations along the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American people. This invasion at the southern border requires the Federal Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States. Yet some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws. This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government&#8217;s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States. Beyond the intolerable national security risks, such nullification efforts often violate Federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal aliens (8 U.S.C. 1324), conspiracy against the United States (18 U.S.C. 371), and conspiracy to impede Federal law enforcement (18 U.S.C. 372). Assisting aliens in violating Federal immigration law could also violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.). Some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily violate Federal laws prohibiting discrimination against Americans in favor of illegal aliens and protecting Americans&#8217; civil rights. It is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of United States law. Sec . 2 . Designation of &#8220;Sanctuary&#8221; Jurisdictions . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall publish a list of States and local jurisdictions that obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws (sanctuary jurisdictions). After this initial publication, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall update this list as necessary. (b) Immediately following each publication under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance of Federal immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of Federal criminal law. Sec . 3 . Consequences for Sanctuary Jurisdiction Status . (a) With respect to sanctuary jurisdictions that are designated under section 2(a) of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and as permitted by law, shall identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate. (b) With respect to jurisdictions that remain sanctuary jurisdictions after State or local officials are provided notice of such status under section 2(b) of this order and yet remain in defiance of Federal law, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to end these violations and bring such jurisdictions into compliance with the laws of the United States. Sec . 4 . Preventing Federal Benefits for Aliens in Sanctuary Jurisdictions . The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall develop guidance, rules, or other appropriate mechanisms to ensure appropriate eligibility verification is conducted for individuals receiving Federal public benefits within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. 1611(c) from private entities in a sanctuary jurisdiction, whether such verification is conducted by the private entity or by a governmental entity on its behalf. Sec . 5 . Equal Treatment of Americans . The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and appropriate agency heads, shall identify and take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws, regulations, policies, and practices favoring aliens over any groups of American citizens that are unlawful, preempted by Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable, including State laws that provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-State American citizens that may violate 8 U.S.C. 1623 or that favor aliens in criminal charges or sentencing. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy . It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce the historic and robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in Federal law. The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the Government. Indeed, the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the early settlers who fled religious persecution in Europe, seeking a new world where they could choose, follow, and practice their faith without interference from the Government. The principle of religious liberty was enshrined in American law with the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1791. Since that time, the Constitution has protected the fundamental right to religious liberty as Americans&#8217; first freedom. During my first term, I issued Executive Order 13798 of May 4, 2017 (Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty). Pursuant to that order, the Attorney General issued a memorandum for all executive departments and agencies (agencies) titled &#8220;Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty&#8221; on October 6, 2017. The Supreme Court has also continued to vindicate the Founders&#8217; commitment to religious liberty, including by giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed on an equal basis in the public square. In recent years, some Federal, State, and local policies have threatened America&#8217;s unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty. These policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections, prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools, threaten loss of funding or denial of non-profit tax status for faith-based entities, and single out religious groups and institutions for exclusion from governmental programs. Some opponents of religious liberty would remove religion entirely from public life. Others characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights, despite religions&#8217; vital roles in the abolition of slavery; the passage of Federal civil rights laws; and the provision of indispensable social, educational, and health services. President Ronald Reagan reminded us that &#8220;freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.&#8221; Americans need to be reacquainted with our Nation&#8217;s superb experiment in religious freedom in order to preserve it against emerging threats. Therefore, the Federal Government will promote citizens&#8217; pride in our foundational history, identify emerging threats to religious liberty, uphold Federal laws that protect all citizens&#8217; full participation in a pluralistic democracy, and protect the free exercise of religion. Sec . 2 . Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission . (a) There is hereby established the Religious Liberty Commission (Commission). (b) The Commission shall function as follows: (i) The Commission shall be composed of up to 14 members appointed by the President. Members of the Commission shall include individuals chosen to serve as educated representatives of various sectors of society, including the private sector, employers, educational institutions, religious communities, and States, to offer diverse perspectives on how the Federal Government can defend religious liberty for all Americans. The President shall designate a Chairman and Vice Chairman from among the members. The Commission shall also include the following ex officio members or such senior officials as those members may designate: (A) the Attorney General; (B) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and (C) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. (ii) Members appointed to the Commission shall serve one term ending on July 4, 2026, which marks the 250th anniversary of American Independence. If the term of the Commission is extended by the President beyond July 4, 2026, members shall be eligible for reappointment for a 2-year term. Members may continue to serve after the expiration of their terms until the appointment of a successor. (iii) The Commission shall produce a comprehensive report on the foundations of religious liberty in America, the impact of religious liberty on American society, current threats to domestic religious liberty, strategies to preserve and enhance religious liberty protections for future generations, and programs to increase awareness of and celebrate America&#8217;s peaceful religious pluralism. Specific topics to be considered by the Commission under these categories shall include the following areas: the First Amendment rights of pastors, religious leaders, houses of worship, faith-based institutions, and religious speakers; attacks across America on houses of worship of many religions; debanking of religious entities; the First Amendment rights of teachers, students, military chaplains, service members, employers, and employees; conscience protections in the health care field and concerning vaccine mandates; parents&#8217; authority to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children, including the right to choose a religious education; permitting time for voluntary prayer and religious instruction at public schools; Government displays with religious imagery; and the right of all Americans to freely exercise their faith without fear or Government censorship or retaliation. (iv) The Commission shall advise the White House Faith Office and the Domestic Policy Council on religious liberty policies of the United States. Specific activities of the Commission shall include, to the extent permitted by law, recommending steps to secure domestic religious liberty by executive or legislative actions as well as identifying opportunities for the White House Faith Office to partner with the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom to further the cause of religious liberty around the world. (v) Members of the Commission shall serve without any compensation for their work on the Commission. Members of the Commission, while engaged in the work of the Commission, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds. (vi) To advise members of the Commission: (A) An Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be designated by the President and shall consist of not more than 15 members. The Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission; (B) An Advisory Board of Lay Leaders from religious congregations shall be designated by the President and shall consist of not more than 15 members. The Advisory Board of Lay Leaders shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission; and (C) An Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be designated by the President and shall consist of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General&#8217;s designee, and not more than 10 attorneys. The Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission. (vii) The Commission shall terminate on July 4, 2026, which marks the 250th anniversary of American Independence, unless extended by the President. (viii) The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Commission may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations. (ix) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act (chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code) may apply to the Commission or any of its Advisory Boards, any functions of the President under that Act, except for those in sections 1005 and 1013 of that Act, shall be performed by the Attorney General, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services. Sec . 3 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any agency, person, or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies, persons, or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took unprecedented action to improve the well-being of the American people by restoring capacity for domestic production of critical pharmaceutical products. Notably, in Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security By Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made In The United States), I directed each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines , Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation&#8217;s supply chains for these products. Unfortunately, the prior administration did too little to advance these goals. Critical barriers and information gaps persist in establishing a domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for American patients. One key area of concern is the length of time it takes to&nbsp;build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States today. &nbsp;New construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects. &nbsp;For pharmaceutical manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities. &nbsp;Industry estimates suggest that building new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint. &nbsp;Even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing underutilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically. It is in the best interest of the Nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines Americans need. &nbsp;My Administration will work to make the United States the most competitive nation in the world for the manufacture of safe and effective pharmaceutical products. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that the regulation of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined to facilitate the restoration of a robust domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base. Sec . 3 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Food and Drug Administration . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner), shall review existing regulations and guidance that pertain to the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and shall take steps to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance; maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review; and streamline and accelerate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. The FDA Commissioner&#8217;s review shall encompass all regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States. The FDA Commissioner shall: (a) &nbsp;evaluate the current risk-based approach to prior approval of licensure inspections, including when such inspections are necessary, and seek to improve upon this approach to ensure all required inspections are prompt, efficient, and limited to what is necessary to ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other Federal law; (b) identify and undertake measures necessary to expand, as practicable, existing programs that provide early technical advice before a facility is operational; (c) &nbsp;identify and undertake measures necessary to improve enforcement of data reporting under section 510(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(j)(3)), including consideration of publicly displaying the list of facilities, including foreign facilities, that are not in compliance; (d) &nbsp;provide clearer guidance regarding the requirements or recommendations for site changes, including moving production from a foreign to domestic facility, and validation of new or updated components necessary in manufacturing; and (e) &nbsp;review and, as appropriate, seek to update any other relevant compliance policies, guidance documents, and regulations. Sec . 4 . Enhancing Inspection of Foreign Manufacturing Facilities . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the FDA Commissioner shall develop and advance improvements to the risk-based inspection regime that ensures routine reviews of overseas manufacturing facilities involved in the supply of United States medicines, which shall be funded by increased fees on foreign manufacturing facilities to the extent consistent with applicable law. Additionally, the FDA Commissioner shall publicly disclose the annual number of inspections that the FDA conducts on such foreign facilities, with specific detail by country and by manufacturer. Sec . 5 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Environmental Protection Agency . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall take action to update regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements and maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review. Sec . 6 . Centralized Coordination of Environmental Permits to Expand Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Capacity . For purposes of 42 U.S.C. 4336a, the EPA shall be the lead agency for the permitting of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities that require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. , unless that role is assumed by another agency. The lead agency shall designate a single point of contact within the agency to coordinate with permit applicants.

Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took unprecedented action to improve the well-being of the American people by restoring capacity for domestic production of critical pharmaceutical products. Notably, in Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security By Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made In The United States), I directed each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines , Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation’s supply chains for these products. Unfortunately, the prior administration did too little to advance these goals. Critical barriers and information gaps persist in establishing a domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for American patients. One key area of concern is the length of time it takes to build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States today. New construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects. For pharmaceutical manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities. Industry estimates suggest that building new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint. Even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing underutilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically. It is in the best interest of the Nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines Americans need. My Administration will work to make the United States the most competitive nation in the world for the manufacture of safe and effective pharmaceutical products. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that the regulation of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined to facilitate the restoration of a robust domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base. Sec . 3 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Food and Drug Administration . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner), shall review existing regulations and guidance that pertain to the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and shall take steps to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance; maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review; and streamline and accelerate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. The FDA Commissioner’s review shall encompass all regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States. The FDA Commissioner shall: (a) evaluate the current risk-based approach to prior approval of licensure inspections, including when such inspections are necessary, and seek to improve upon this approach to ensure all required inspections are prompt, efficient, and limited to what is necessary to ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other Federal law; (b) identify and undertake measures necessary to expand, as practicable, existing programs that provide early technical advice before a facility is operational; (c) identify and undertake measures necessary to improve enforcement of data reporting under section 510(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(j)(3)), including consideration of publicly displaying the list of facilities, including foreign facilities, that are not in compliance; (d) provide clearer guidance regarding the requirements or recommendations for site changes, including moving production from a foreign to domestic facility, and validation of new or updated components necessary in manufacturing; and (e) review and, as appropriate, seek to update any other relevant compliance policies, guidance documents, and regulations. Sec . 4 . Enhancing Inspection of Foreign Manufacturing Facilities . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the FDA Commissioner shall develop and advance improvements to the risk-based inspection regime that ensures routine reviews of overseas manufacturing facilities involved in the supply of United States medicines, which shall be funded by increased fees on foreign manufacturing facilities to the extent consistent with applicable law. Additionally, the FDA Commissioner shall publicly disclose the annual number of inspections that the FDA conducts on such foreign facilities, with specific detail by country and by manufacturer. Sec . 5 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Environmental Protection Agency . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall take action to update regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements and maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review. Sec . 6 . Centralized Coordination of Environmental Permits to Expand Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Capacity . For purposes of 42 U.S.C. 4336a, the EPA shall be the lead agency for the permitting of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities that require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. , unless that role is assumed by another agency. The lead agency shall designate a single point of contact within the agency to coordinate with permit applicants. The Office of Management and Budget shall coordinate with the lead agency and with other relevant agencies and the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Committee, as needed, to expedite the review and approval of relevant permits. Sec . 7 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the United States Army Corps of Engineers . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall review the nationwide permits issued under section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1344) and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) to determine whether an activity-specific nationwide permit is needed to facilitate the efficient permitting of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Sec . 8 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . Dangerous gain-of-function research on biological agents and pathogens has the potential to significantly endanger the lives of American citizens. If left unrestricted, its effects can include widespread mortality, an impaired public health system, disrupted American livelihoods, and diminished economic and national security. The Biden Administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research within the United States with insufficient levels of oversight. It also actively approved, through the National Institutes of Health, Federal life-science research funding in China and other countries where there is limited United States oversight or reasonable expectation of biosafety enforcement. This recklessness, if unaddressed, may lead to the proliferation of research on pathogens (and potential pathogens) in settings without adequate safeguards, even after COVID-19 revealed the risk of such practices. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to ensure that United States federally funded research benefits American citizens without jeopardizing our Nation&#8217;s security, strength, or prosperity. My Administration will balance the prevention of catastrophic consequences with maintaining readiness against biological threats and driving global leadership in biotechnology, biological countermeasures, biosecurity, and health research. Sec . 3 . Stop Dangerous Gain-of-Function Research . (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) identified by the Director of OSTP, shall establish guidance for the heads of relevant agencies, to the extent consistent with the terms and conditions of the funding, to immediately: (i) end Federal funding of dangerous gain-of-function research conducted by foreign entities in countries of concern (e.g., China) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6627(c), or in other countries where there is not adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with United States oversight standards and policies; and (ii) end Federal funding of other life-science research that is occurring in countries of concern or foreign countries where there is not adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with United States oversight standards and policies and that could reasonably pose a threat to public health, public safety, and economic or national security, as determined by the heads of relevant agencies. (b) The Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the APNSA, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish guidance for the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies with respect to suspension of federally funded dangerous gain-of-function research, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the relevant research funding, at least until the completion of the policy called for in section 4(a) of this order. Heads of agencies shall report any exception to a suspension to the Director of OSTP for review in consultation with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies. Sec . 4 .

(a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6627 and in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall revise or replace the 2024 &#8220; United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential &#8221; to: (i) strengthen top-down independent oversight; increase accountability through enforcement, audits, and improved public transparency; and clearly define the scope of covered research while ensuring the United States remains the global leader in biotechnology, biological countermeasures, and health research; (ii) incorporate enforcement mechanisms, including those described in section 7 of this order, into Federal funding agreements to ensure compliance with all Federal policies governing dangerous gain-of-function research; and (iii) provide for review and revision at least every 4 years, or as appropriate. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall revise or replace the 2024 &#8220; Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening &#8221; (Framework) to ensure it takes a commonsense approach and effectively encourages providers of synthetic nucleic acid sequences to implement comprehensive, scalable, and verifiable synthetic nucleic acid procurement screening mechanisms to minimize the risk of misuse. The heads of all agencies that fund life-science research shall ensure that synthetic nucleic acid procurement is conducted through providers or manufacturers that adhere to the updated Framework. To ensure compliance, the updated Framework shall incorporate the enforcement mechanisms described in section 7 of this order. The Framework shall be reviewed and revised at least every 4 years, or as appropriate Sec . 5 . Manage Risks Associated with Non-federally Funded Research . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the APNSA, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall develop and implement a strategy to govern, limit, and track dangerous gain-of-function research across the United States that occurs without Federal funding and other life-science research that could cause significant societal consequences. This strategy shall include actions to achieve comprehensive, scalable, and verifiable nucleic acid synthesis screening in non-federally funded settings.

For several decades, invasive species of Asian carp have steadily migrated and expanded from the Southeast northward through streams, rivers, and lakes in the Mississippi River and Midwest region.&nbsp; Asian carp, which can exceed 100 pounds in weight, spread rapidly by outcompeting native fish populations for food and space.&nbsp; They also reduce water quality.&nbsp; These invasive carp are nearing the entry point to the Great Lakes, which, if breached, would irreparably damage native fish species like walleye, yellow perch, and lake whitefish.&nbsp; This poses a significant risk to Great Lakes fishing, boating, recreation, and tourism, which support tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of commerce annually.&nbsp; The Brandon Road Interbasin Project near Joliet, Illinois, was authorized for construction in the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-260) and would provide multiple layers of innovative technological deterrents designed to prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;joint project involving the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) and the States of Illinois and Michigan. The Federal Government has provided $274 million for this project, has undertaken design work, has started site preparation, and is ready to begin construction of deterrent measures.&nbsp; In February 2025, however, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker decided to delay the State&#8217;s acquisition of property, which is necessary for construction to begin.&nbsp; Once Illinois acquires the land, it must also issue the Army Corps a State-level permit to begin construction. My Administration fully supports preventing the spread of invasive carp.&nbsp; The State of Illinois, where the Brandon Road Interbasin Project is located, must cease further delay in cooperating with this effort, for the sake of its own citizens and economy and for the sake of all of the Great Lakes States.&nbsp; I am directing my Administration to achieve maximum speed and efficiency at the Federal level.&nbsp; Specifically, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Army, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine and expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers, and other measures to prevent the migration and expansion of invasive carp in the Great Lakes Basin and the surrounding region.&nbsp; This includes supporting the Brandon Road Interbasin Project, through deadline-oriented investments of taxpayer dollars, to ensure the State of Illinois does not stand in the way of its construction.&nbsp; Specifically, for this project to remain on schedule so that it can effectively fulfill its purpose and constitute a worthy investment of taxpayer resources, the State of Illinois should acquire the necessary land to begin construction of the Brandon Road Interbasin Project by July 1, 2025, and the State of Illinois and any applicable localities should grant all permits or approvals required to facilitate Army Corps construction within 30 days of such permits or approvals becoming ripe for consideration by the State or locality and should streamline all permitting and environmental reviews to the maximum degree.&nbsp; Federal agency heads shall similarly streamline any permitting and environmental reviews and issue any requisite Federal permits or approvals as quickly as possible. Additionally, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall prioritize support for infrastructure projects to remove invasive carp from the Upper Illinois Waterway near Lake Michigan and for maintenance on existing infrastructure to block invasive carp from reaching and entering the Great Lakes Basin.

Background . In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and economy of the United States. Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257 provided that &#8220;[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.&#8221; In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People&#8217;s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I ordered modifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable ad valorem duty rate for imports from the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and Executive Order 14259. Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, &#8220;[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.&#8221; Since I signed Executive Order 14266, the United States has entered into discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns. Conducting these discussions is a significant step by the PRC toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters. Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of 90 days application of the additional ad valorem duties imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, as amended by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, and clarified in the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025 (Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended), and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an additional ad valorem rate of duty as set forth herein, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order. Sec . 2 . Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rate of Duty . Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United States from the PRC, including Hong Kong and Macau, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257 and the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025. This ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent reflects (i) the modification of the application of the additional ad valorem rate of duty on articles of China (including articles of Hong Kong and Macau) set forth in Executive Order 14257, by suspending 24 percentage points of that rate for an initial period of 90 days, and the retention of the remaining ad valorem rate of 10 percent on those articles pursuant to the terms of said order; and (ii) the removal of the modified additional ad valorem rates of duty on those articles imposed by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266. Sec . 3 . Tariff Modifications . In recognition of the intentions of the PRC to facilitate addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, the HTSUS shall be modified as follows: Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025: (a) heading 9903.01.25 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting the article description and by inserting &#8220;Articles the product of any country, except for products described in headings 9903.01.26–9903.01.33, and except as provided for in heading 9903.01.34, as provided for in subdivision (v) of U.S. note 2 to this subchapter . . . . . . &#8221; in lieu thereof; (b) heading 9903.01.63 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;125%&#8221; each place that it appears and by inserting &#8220;34%&#8221; in lieu thereof; (c) subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;125%&#8221;, and by inserting &#8220;34%&#8221; in lieu thereof; and (d) heading 9903.01.63 and subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are hereby suspended for a period of 90 days beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025. Sec . 4 . De Minimi s Tariff Decrease . To ensure that the reduction in duties pursuant to section 2 of this order is made fully effective and the purpose of Executive Order 14257, as amended, is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to: (a) decrease the ad valorem rate of duty set forth in section 2(c)(i) of Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, from 120 percent to 54 percent; (b) retain in effect the per postal item containing goods duty of 100 dollars in section 2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, that has been in effect since 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, unless and until otherwise modified by a subsequent executive action, notwithstanding the increase contemplated effective June 1, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266; and (c) modify the HTSUS, effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, as follows: (i) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;120 percent&#8221;, and by inserting &#8220;54 percent&#8221; in lieu thereof; and (ii) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025. For merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, the applicable specific duty rate is $200 per postal item containing such goods.&#8221; Sec . 5 . Implementation . The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, are directed to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register and adopting rules and regulations, and are authorized to take such actions, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose . Abundant energy is a vital national- and economic-security interest. In conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can liberate America from dependence on geopolitical rivals. It can power not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cutting-edge, energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Between 1954 and 1978, the United States authorized the construction of 133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants. Since 1978, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has authorized only a fraction of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into commercial operation. The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development. The NRC has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever. This failure stems from a fundamental error: Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure. Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. A myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects. Recent events in Europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in Spain and Portugal, underscore the importance of my Administration&#8217;s focus on dispatchable power generation &#8211;including nuclear power &#8212; over intermittent power. Beginning today, my Administration will reform the NRC, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic operations. In so doing, we will produce lasting American dominance in the global nuclear energy market, create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs, and generate American-led prosperity and resilience. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to: (a) Reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear energy; (b) Facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry; (c) Facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050; (d) Employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs; (e) Support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and (f) Maintain the United States&#8217; leading reputation for nuclear safety. Sec . 3 . Reforming the NRC&#8217;s Culture . The Congress has mandated that the NRC&#8217;s &#8220;licensing and regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not unnecessarily limit &#8212; (1) the civilian use of radioactive materials and deployment of nuclear energy; or (2) the benefits of civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society.&#8221; Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024, Public Law 118-67, sec. 501(a). Just as the Congress directed, the NRC&#8217;s mission shall include facilitating nuclear power while ensuring reactor safety. When carrying out its licensing and related regulatory functions, the NRC shall consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to our economic and national security in addition to safety, health, and environmental considerations. Sec . 4 . Reforming the NRC&#8217;s Structure . (a) The current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress&#8217;s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power. The NRC shall, in consultation with the NRC&#8217;s DOGE Team (as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221;)), and consistent with its governing statutes, reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology. The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing. The NRC shall also create a dedicated team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations directed by section 5 of this order. (b) The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill ACRS&#8217;s statutory obligations. Review by ACRS of permitting and licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or noteworthy. Sec . 5 . Reforming and Modernizing the NRC&#8217;s Regulations . The NRC, working with its DOGE Team, the Office of Management and Budget, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months of the date of this order. The NRC shall issue final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this order. In conducting this wholesale revision, the NRC shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in particular: (a) Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, rather than the nonbinding &#8220;generic milestone schedules&#8221; guidelines the NRC has already adopted. Those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the NRC&#8217;s recovery of hourly fees. The deadlines shall include: (1) a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process, and (2) a deadline of no more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process. The regulations should not provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the licensing process successfully in the time allotted. Moreover, these are maximum time periods; the NRC shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate. (b) Adopt science-based radiation limits. In particular, the NRC shall reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; standard, which is predicated on LNT. Those models are flawed, as discussed in section 1 of this order. In reconsidering those limits, the NRC shall specifically consider adopting determinate radiation limits, and in doing so shall consult with the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency. (c) Revise, in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, NRC regulations governing NRC&#8217;s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act to reflect the Congress&#8217;s 2023 amendments to that statute and the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy). (d) Establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the DOD or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely. NRC review of such designs shall focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by NRC licensure, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed in the DOE or DOD processes. (e) Establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors, including by allowing for standardized applications and approvals and by considering to what extent such reactors or components thereof should be regulated through general licenses. (f) Establish stringent thresholds for circumstances in which the NRC may demand changes to reactor design once construction is underway. (g) Revise the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules and requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible risks. (h) Adopt revised and, where feasible, determinate and data-backed thresholds to ensure that reactor safety assessments focus on credible, realistic risks. (i) Reconsider the regulations governing the time period for which a renewed license remains effective, and extend that period as appropriate based on available technological and safety data. (j) Streamline the public hearings process. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall provide funding for publication of this order in the Federal Register . DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 23, 2025.

The United States led the development of civilian nuclear power through the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Reactor Testing Station (now known as Idaho National Laboratory), and several other Federal Government entities. This work produced safe and abundant energy. But in the decades since, commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped. The Idaho National Laboratory has principal responsibility for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded construction of new reactors in the 1970s. Our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency. As I stated in Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), the United States needs a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security. Nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise. Decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety mechanisms, improve the physical architecture of reactor designs, increase reactor operational flexibility and performance, and reduce risk in fuel disposal. Advanced reactors &#8212; including microreactors, small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors &#8212; have revolutionary potential. They will open a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries. The United States cultivated the effort to design and build the first Generation IV reactor for commercial use, but the Federal Government has effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors, ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology. That changes today. It is the policy of my Administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a) The term &#8220;advanced reactor&#8221; has the same meaning as the term &#8220;advanced nuclear reactor&#8221; in 42 U.S.C. 16271(b)(1). (b) The term &#8220;Department&#8221; means the Department of Energy. (c) The term &#8220;qualified test reactor&#8221; means an advanced reactor that satisfies thresholds established by the Department sufficient to demonstrate that, from the perspective of technical development and financial backing, the reactor may feasibly be operational within 2 years from the date a substantially complete application is submitted. (d) The term &#8220;Secretary&#8221; means the Secretary of Energy. Sec . 3 . Findings . With some rare and arguable exceptions, no advanced reactors have yet been deployed in America. I find that design, construction, operation, and disposition of such reactors under the auspices of the Department &#8212; and not to produce commercial electric power &#8212; would be for research purposes, rather than &#8220;for the purpose of demonstrating the suitability for commercial application of . . . a reactor&#8221; within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 5842. The purpose of testing these reactors at this stage in America&#8217;s industrial evolution is to establish fundamental technological viability. Thus, at least for the foreseeable future, advanced reactors over which the Department exercises sufficient control and that do not produce commercial electric power, including those &#8220;under contract with and for the account of the [Department],&#8221; 42 U.S.C. 2140(a)(2), fall within the jurisdiction of the Department, which has authority to foster research and development in nuclear reactors. Nothing in this section alters the authority or jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. Sec . 4 . Reforming the National Laboratory Process for Reactor Testing . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of this order. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures and practices of the Department, the National Laboratories, and any other entity under the Department&#8217;s jurisdiction to significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under the Department&#8217;s jurisdiction. The Secretary shall ensure that the Department&#8217;s expedited procedures enable qualified test reactors to be safely operational at Department-owned or Department-controlled facilities within 2 years following the submission of a substantially complete application. (c) Upon finding that an applicant has submitted a substantially complete application for a qualified test reactor, the Secretary shall establish a team consisting of representatives from the Secretary&#8217;s office, the relevant National Laboratory or Laboratories, the Department&#8217;s Office of General Counsel, and any other entities within the Department that possess the authority to deconflict, oppose, or approve the application. The team shall provide assistance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application. For these purposes, each member shall report directly to the Secretary. (d) The Secretary shall prioritize qualified test reactor projects for processing, as consistent with applicable law. Sec . 5 . Establishing a Pilot Program Outside the National Laboratories . (a) The Secretary shall create a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside the National Laboratories, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act&#8217;s authorization of reactors under the Department&#8217;s sufficient control, including reactors &#8220;under contract with and for the account of&#8221; the Department, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2140. The Secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026. (b) Upon approval of an application for this pilot program, the Secretary shall assign a team to provide assistance to the applicant as specified in subsection 4(c) of this order. Sec . 6 . Streamlining Environmental Reviews . (a) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, take action to reform the Department&#8217;s rules governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) no later than June 30, 2025, consistent with the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy), and with applicable law. (b) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department&#8217;s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant. In addition to the measures outlined in section 7 of the Executive Order of May 23, 2025 (Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security), such measures shall include determining which Department functions are not subject to NEPA, creating categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), relying on supplemental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites, or utilizing alternative procedures under NEPA. Sec . 7 . Implementation . The Secretary shall work with the DOGE Team Lead at the Department, as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221;), with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to implement this order. Sec . 8 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Sec . 2 .&nbsp; Policy .&nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to&nbsp;expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people, to power advanced nuclear reactor technologies, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 16271 (b)(1)(A), and to build associated supply chains that secure our global industrial and digital dominance, achieve our energy independence, protect our national security, and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of nuclear fuel through recycling, reprocessing, and reinvigorating the commercial sector. Sec . 3 .&nbsp; Strengthening the Domestic Nuclear Fuel Cycle .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall prepare and submit to the President, through the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a report that includes: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a recommended national policy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustainable long-term fuel cycle; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a review of relevant statutory authorities to&nbsp;identify any legislative changes necessary or desirable to achieve the national policy recommended under subsection (a)(i) of this section; (iii)&nbsp; &nbsp;an evaluation of the reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel from the operation of Department of Defense and Department of Energy reactors and other spent nuclear fuel managed by the Department of Energy, along with a discussion of steps the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy are taking or must take to improve such reprocessing and recycling processes; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an analysis of legal, budgetary, and policy considerations relevant to efficiently transferring spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a government-owned, privately operated reprocessing and recycling facility; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommendations for the efficient use of the uranium, plutonium, and other products recovered through recycling and reprocessing; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommendations for the efficient disposal of the wastes generated by recycling or reprocessing through a permanent disposal pathway; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp; a recommended process for evaluating, prior to disposal, nuclear waste materials for isotopes of value to national security, or medical, industrial, and scientific sectors; (viii)&nbsp; a reevaluation of historic and current nuclear reprocessing, separation, and storage facilities slated for decommissioning and that are identified as having valuable materials, isotopes, equipment, licenses, operations, or experienced workers, and that may have potential fuel cycle or national security benefits if operations are continued or increased; and (ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a program to develop methods and technologies to transport, domestically and overseas, used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors containing such fuels in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner, including any legislation required to support this initiative. (b) &nbsp;Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Director of OMB, shall develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs for low enriched uranium (LEU), high enriched uranium (HEU) and high assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU), subject to retention of such stockpiles as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. &nbsp;The plan shall be implemented based on the timeframes set forth in the plan. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy shall halt the surplus plutonium dilute and dispose program except with respect to the Department of Energy&#8217;s legal obligations to the State of South Carolina. &nbsp;In place of this program, the Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available to industry in a form that can be utilized for the fabrication of fuel for advanced nuclear technologies. &nbsp; (d) &nbsp;Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense as appropriate, shall update the Department of Energy&#8217;s excess uranium management policy to align with the policy objectives of this order and the Nuclear Fuel Security Act, factoring in the national security need to modernize the United States nuclear weapon stockpile. &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy shall prioritize contracting for the development of fuel fabrication facilities that demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility to supply fuel to qualified test reactors or pilot program reactors within 3 years from the date of such applications. (e) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, shall utilize the authority provided to the President in section 708(c)(1) of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) (50 U.S.C. 4558 (c)(1)), which has been delegated to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), to seek voluntary agreements pursuant to section 708 of the DPA with domestic nuclear energy companies.&nbsp; The Secretary of Energy should prioritize agreements with those companies that have achieved objective milestones (e.g., Department of Energy-approved conceptual safety design reports, the ability to privately finance their fuel, or the demonstrated technology capability) for the cooperative procurement of LEU and HALEU, including as needed by the Federal Government for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons.&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy, the Attorney General, and the&nbsp;Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall take all necessary and appropriate steps under sections 708(c), (d), (e), and (f)(1)(A) of the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4558(c), (d), (e), (f)(1)(A)), for the Secretary of Energy to form agreements pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall, after consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, consider whether to make the finding described in section 708(f)(1)(B) of the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4558(f)(1)(B)), with respect to any agreement and, no later than 30 days after any voluntary agreement is reached, shall publish such finding as appropriate.&nbsp; (h) &nbsp;Such voluntary agreements shall further allow consultation with domestic nuclear energy companies to discuss and implement methods to enhance the capability to manage spent nuclear fuel, including the recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, to ensure the continued reliable operation of the Nation&#8217;s nuclear reactors. &nbsp;Such voluntary agreements shall also allow industry consultation to establish consortia and plans of action to ensure that the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity, including milling, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, fabrication, recycling, or reprocessing, is available to enable the continued reliable operation of the Nation&#8217;s existing, and future, nuclear reactors.&nbsp; The Secretary of Energy, consistent with applicable law, is authorized to provide procurement support, forward contracts, or guarantees to such consortia as a&nbsp;means to ensure offtake for newly established domestic fuel supply, including conversion, enrichment, reprocessing, or fabrication capacity. Sec . 4 .&nbsp; Funding for Restart, Completion, Uprate, or Construction of Nuclear Plants .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;To maximize the speed and scale of new nuclear capacity, the Department of Energy shall prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5&nbsp;gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. &nbsp;To help achieve these objectives, the Secretary of Energy, through the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, shall, subject to the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act and other applicable law and OMB Circular A-11, prioritize activities that support nuclear energy, including actions to make available resources for restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power output of operating nuclear power plants, completing construction of nuclear reactors that was prematurely suspended, constructing new advanced nuclear reactors, and improving all associated aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain. &nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy shall also coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support, consistent with applicable law, focusing initially on installations with insufficient power resilience or grid fragility.

Purpose . The United States originally pioneered nuclear energy technology during a time of great peril. We now face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence, a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security. It took nearly 40 years for the United States to add the same amount of nuclear capacity as another developed nation added in 10 years. Further, as American deployment of advanced reactor designs has waned, 87 percent of nuclear reactors installed worldwide since 2017 are based on designs from two foreign countries. At the same time, the Nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, leaving the United States heavily dependent on foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and conversion services. These trends cannot continue. Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people, to power advanced nuclear reactor technologies, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 16271 (b)(1)(A), and to build associated supply chains that secure our global industrial and digital dominance, achieve our energy independence, protect our national security, and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of nuclear fuel through recycling, reprocessing, and reinvigorating the commercial sector. Sec . 3 . Strengthening the Domestic Nuclear Fuel Cycle . (a) Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall prepare and submit to the President, through the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a report that includes: (i) a recommended national policy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustainable long-term fuel cycle; (ii) a review of relevant statutory authorities to identify any legislative changes necessary or desirable to achieve the national policy recommended under subsection (a)(i) of this section; (iii) an evaluation of the reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel from the operation of Department of Defense and Department of Energy reactors and other spent nuclear fuel managed by the Department of Energy, along with a discussion of steps the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy are taking or must take to improve such reprocessing and recycling processes; (iv) an analysis of legal, budgetary, and policy considerations relevant to efficiently transferring spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a government-owned, privately operated reprocessing and recycling facility; (v) recommendations for the efficient use of the uranium, plutonium, and other products recovered through recycling and reprocessing; (vi) recommendations for the efficient disposal of the wastes generated by recycling or reprocessing through a permanent disposal pathway; (vii) a recommended process for evaluating, prior to disposal, nuclear waste materials for isotopes of value to national security, or medical, industrial, and scientific sectors; (viii) a reevaluation of historic and current nuclear reprocessing, separation, and storage facilities slated for decommissioning and that are identified as having valuable materials, isotopes, equipment, licenses, operations, or experienced workers, and that may have potential fuel cycle or national security benefits if operations are continued or increased; and (ix) a program to develop methods and technologies to transport, domestically and overseas, used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors containing such fuels in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner, including any legislation required to support this initiative. (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Director of OMB, shall develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs for low enriched uranium (LEU), high enriched uranium (HEU) and high assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU), subject to retention of such stockpiles as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. The plan shall be implemented based on the timeframes set forth in the plan. (c) The Secretary of Energy shall halt the surplus plutonium dilute and dispose program except with respect to the Department of Energy’s legal obligations to the State of South Carolina. In place of this program, the Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available to industry in a form that can be utilized for the fabrication of fuel for advanced nuclear technologies. (d) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense as appropriate, shall update the Department of Energy’s excess uranium management policy to align with the policy objectives of this order and the Nuclear Fuel Security Act, factoring in the national security need to modernize the United States nuclear weapon stockpile. The Secretary of Energy shall prioritize contracting for the development of fuel fabrication facilities that demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility to supply fuel to qualified test reactors or pilot program reactors within 3 years from the date of such applications. (e) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, shall utilize the authority provided to the President in section 708(c)(1) of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) (50 U.S.C. 4558 (c)(1)), which has been delegated to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), to seek voluntary agreements pursuant to section 708 of the DPA with domestic nuclear energy companies. The Secretary of Energy should prioritize agreements with those companies that have achieved objective milestones (e.g., Department of Energy-approved conceptual safety design reports, the ability to privately finance their fuel, or the demonstrated technology capability) for the cooperative procurement of LEU and HALEU, including as needed by the Federal Government for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. (f) The Secretary of Energy, the Attorney General, and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall take all necessary and appropriate steps under sections 708(c), (d), (e), and (f)(1)(A) of the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4558(c), (d), (e), (f)(1)(A)), for the Secretary of Energy to form agreements pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. (g) The Attorney General shall, after consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, consider whether to make the finding described in section 708(f)(1)(B) of the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4558(f)(1)(B)), with respect to any agreement and, no later than 30 days after any voluntary agreement is reached, shall publish such finding as appropriate. (h) Such voluntary agreements shall further allow consultation with domestic nuclear energy companies to discuss and implement methods to enhance the capability to manage spent nuclear fuel, including the recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, to ensure the continued reliable operation of the Nation’s nuclear reactors. Such voluntary agreements shall also allow industry consultation to establish consortia and plans of action to ensure that the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity, including milling, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, fabrication, recycling, or reprocessing, is available to enable the continued reliable operation of the Nation’s existing, and future, nuclear reactors. The Secretary of Energy, consistent with applicable law, is authorized to provide procurement support, forward contracts, or guarantees to such consortia as a means to ensure offtake for newly established domestic fuel supply, including conversion, enrichment, reprocessing, or fabrication capacity. Sec . 4 . Funding for Restart, Completion, Uprate, or Construction of Nuclear Plants . (a) To maximize the speed and scale of new nuclear capacity, the Department of Energy shall prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. To help achieve these objectives, the Secretary of Energy, through the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, shall, subject to the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act and other applicable law and OMB Circular A-11, prioritize activities that support nuclear energy, including actions to make available resources for restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power output of operating nuclear power plants, completing construction of nuclear reactors that was prematurely suspended, constructing new advanced nuclear reactors, and improving all associated aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain. (b) The Secretary of Energy shall also coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support, consistent with applicable law, focusing initially on installations with insufficient power resilience or grid fragility. (c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear technologies through grants, loans, investment capital, funding opportunities, and other Federal support. Priority shall be given to those companies demonstrating the largest degrees of design and technological maturity, financial backing, and potential for near-term deployment of their technologies. Sec . 5 . Expanding the Nuclear Energy Workforce . (a) Nuclear engineering and other careers and education pathways that support the nuclear energy industry shall be considered areas of focus and priority pursuant to Executive Order 14278 of April 23, 2025 (Preparing Americans for High-Paying Skilled Trade Jobs of the Future). (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall seek to increase participation in nuclear energy-related Registered Apprenticeships and Career and Technical Education programs by: (i) using apprenticeship intermediary contracts and allocating existing discretionary funds, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to engage industry organizations and employers to perform a gap analysis of apprenticeship programs, and facilitate the development of Registered Apprenticeship programs, in nuclear energy-related occupations that are underrepresented; (ii) encouraging States and grantees to use funding provided under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Public Law 113-128), as amended, to develop nuclear engineering and other nuclear energy-related skills and to support work-based learning opportunities, including issuing related guidance to State and local workforce development boards and others regarding use of such funds for such purposes; and (iii) consistent with applicable law, establishing nuclear engineering and other nuclear energy-related skills training and work-based learning as a grant priority in Employment and Training Administration and Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education discretionary grant programs.

Policy and Purpose . Over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly. A majority of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis. The falsification of data by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally funded research. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has contributed to this loss of trust. In several notable cases, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner. For example, under the prior Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued COVID-19 guidance on reopening schools that incorporated edits by the American Federation of Teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning. This guidance&#8217;s restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomes &#8212; even though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission. The National Marine Fisheries Service justified a biological opinion by adopting an admitted &#8220;worst-case scenario&#8221; projection of the North Atlantic right whale population that it believed was &#8220;very likely&#8221; wrong. The agency&#8217;s proposed actions could have destroyed the historic Maine lobster fishery. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agency&#8217;s decision to seek out the worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence. Similarly, agencies have used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a &#8220;higher&#8221; warming scenario. RCP 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves. Scientists have warned that presenting RCP 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading. Actions taken by the prior Administration further politicized science, for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations into all aspects of science planning, execution, and communication. Scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the Federal Government is critical to maintaining the trust of the American people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science. My Administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. We must restore the American people&#8217;s faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. Reproducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must be maintained. This order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first Administration and ensures that agencies practice data transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of scenarios used, approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate scientific data accurately. Agency use of Gold Standard Science, as set forth in this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &#8220;Employee&#8221; has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105. (b) &#8220;Scientific information&#8221; means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments related to such disciplines as the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, physical sciences, or probability and statistics. This includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. (c) &#8220;Scientific misconduct&#8221; means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting the results of scientific research, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. For the purposes of this definition; (i) &#8220;fabrication&#8221; is making up data or results and recording or reporting them; (ii) &#8220;falsification&#8221; is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record; and (iii) &#8220;plagiarism&#8221; is the appropriation of another person&#8217;s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. (d) &#8220;Senior appointee&#8221; means an individual appointed by the President (or an individual performing the functions and duties of an individual appointed by the President) or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service. (e) &#8220;Weight of scientific evidence&#8221; means an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. Quality and relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data. Sec . 3 . Restoring Gold Standard Science . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP Director) shall, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, issue guidance for agencies on implementation of &#8220;Gold Standard Science&#8221; in the conduct and management of their respective scientific activities. For the purposes of this order, Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is: (i) reproducible; (ii) transparent; (iii) communicative of error and uncertainty; (iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary; (v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions; (vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; (vii) subject to unbiased peer review; (viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and (ix) without conflicts of interest. (b) Upon publication of the guidance prescribed in subsection (a), each agency head, as necessary and appropriate and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the OSTP Director, shall promptly update applicable agency policies governing the production and use of scientific information, including scientific integrity policies, to implement the OSTP Director&#8217;s guidance on Gold Standard Science and ensure that agency scientific activities are conducted in accordance with this order. (c) Each agency head shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the OSTP Director&#8217;s guidance on Gold Standard Science and the requirements of this order into the processes by which their agency conducts, manages, interprets, communicates, and uses scientific or technological information prior to the finalization of the updated policies under this section. (d) Within 60 days of the publication of the guidance prescribed in section 3(a), agency heads shall report to the OSTP Director on the actions taken to implement Gold Standard Science at their agency. Sec . 4 . Improving the Use, Interpretation, and Communication of Scientific Data . No later than 30 days after the date of this order, agency heads and employees shall adhere to the following rules governing the use, interpretation, and communication of scientific data, unless otherwise provided by law: (a) Employees shall not engage in scientific misconduct nor knowingly rely on information resulting from scientific misconduct. (b) Except as prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential business information, agency heads shall in a timely manner and, to the extent practicable and within the agency&#8217;s authority: (i) subject to paragraph (ii), make publicly available the following information within the agency&#8217;s possession: (A) the data, analyses, and conclusions associated with scientific and technological information produced or used by the agency that the agency reasonably assesses will have a clear and substantial effect on important public policies or important private sector decisions (influential scientific information), including data cited in peer-reviewed literature; and (B) the models and analyses (including, as applicable, the source code for such models) the agency used to generate such influential scientific information. Employees may not invoke exemption 5 to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) to prevent disclosure of such models unless authorized in writing to do so by the agency head following prior notice to the OSTP Director. (ii) risk models used to guide agency enforcement actions or select enforcement targets are not information that must be disclosed under this subsection. (c) When using scientific information in agency decision-making, employees shall transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties, including how uncertainty propagates throughout any models used in the analysis. (d) Where employees produce or use scientific information to inform policy or legal determinations they must use science that comports with the legal standards applicable to those determinations, including when agencies evaluate the realistic or reasonably foreseeable effects of an action. (e) Employees shall be transparent about the likelihood of the assumptions and scenarios used. Highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency&#8217;s action. (f) When scientific or technological information is used to inform agency evaluations and subsequent decision-making, employees shall apply a &#8220;weight of scientific evidence&#8221; approach. (g) Employees&#8217; communication of scientific information shall be consistent with the results of the relevant analysis and evaluation and, to the extent that uncertainty is present, the degree of uncertainty should be communicated. Communications involving a scientific model or information derived from a scientific model should include reference to any material assumptions that inform the model&#8217;s outputs. (h) Once the guidance on Gold Standard Science is established and promulgated pursuant to section 3 of this order, it shall, among other things, form the basis for employees’ evaluation of all scientific and technological information called for in this order except where otherwise required by law. Sec . 5 . Interim Scientific Integrity Policies . (a) Until the issuance of updated agency scientific integrity policies pursuant to section 3 of this order, and except where required by law: (i) scientific integrity policies in each agency shall be governed by the scientific integrity policies that existed within the executive branch on January 19, 2021, except that in the event of a conflict between such policies and the policies and requirements of this order, the policies and requirements of this order control; and (ii) agency heads shall take all necessary actions to reevaluate and, where necessary, revise or rescind scientific integrity policies or procedures, or amendments to such policies or procedures, issued between January 20, 2021, and January 20, 2025. (iii) each agency head shall promptly revoke any organizational or operational changes, designations, or documents that were issued or enacted pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking), which was revoked pursuant to Executive Order 14154 and shall conduct applicable agency operations in the manner and revert applicable agency organization to the same form as would have existed in the absence of such changes, designations, or documents. (b) In updating applicable scientific integrity policies pursuant to section 3 of this order, agencies should ensure they: (i) encourage the open exchange of ideas; (ii) provide for consideration of different or dissenting viewpoints; and (iii) protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions.

Policy and Purpose . Over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly. A majority of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis. The falsification of data by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally funded research. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has contributed to this loss of trust. In several notable cases, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner. For example, under the prior Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued COVID-19 guidance on reopening schools that incorporated edits by the American Federation of Teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning. This guidance’s restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomes — even though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission. The National Marine Fisheries Service justified a biological opinion by adopting an admitted “worst-case scenario” projection of the North Atlantic right whale population that it believed was “very likely” wrong. The agency’s proposed actions could have destroyed the historic Maine lobster fishery. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agency’s decision to seek out the worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence. Similarly, agencies have used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a “higher” warming scenario. RCP 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves. Scientists have warned that presenting RCP 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading. Actions taken by the prior Administration further politicized science, for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations into all aspects of science planning, execution, and communication. Scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the Federal Government is critical to maintaining the trust of the American people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science. My Administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. We must restore the American people’s faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. Reproducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must be maintained. This order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first Administration and ensures that agencies practice data transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of scenarios used, approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate scientific data accurately. Agency use of Gold Standard Science, as set forth in this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) “Employee” has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105. (b) “Scientific information” means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments related to such disciplines as the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, physical sciences, or probability and statistics. This includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. (c) “Scientific misconduct” means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting the results of scientific research, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. For the purposes of this definition; (i) “fabrication” is making up data or results and recording or reporting them; (ii) “falsification” is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record; and (iii) “plagiarism” is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. (d) “Senior appointee” means an individual appointed by the President (or an individual performing the functions and duties of an individual appointed by the President) or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service. (e) “Weight of scientific evidence” means an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. Quality and relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data. Sec . 3 . Restoring Gold Standard Science . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP Director) shall, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, issue guidance for agencies on implementation of “Gold Standard Science” in the conduct and management of their respective scientific activities. For the purposes of this order, Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is: (i) reproducible; (ii) transparent; (iii) communicative of error and uncertainty; (iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary; (v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions; (vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; (vii) subject to unbiased peer review; (viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and (ix) without conflicts of interest. (b) Upon publication of the guidance prescribed in subsection (a), each agency head, as necessary and appropriate and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the OSTP Director, shall promptly update applicable agency policies governing the production and use of scientific information, including scientific integrity policies, to implement the OSTP Director’s guidance on Gold Standard Science and ensure that agency scientific activities are conducted in accordance with this order. (c) Each agency head shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the OSTP Director’s guidance on Gold Standard Science and the requirements of this order into the processes by which their agency conducts, manages, interprets, communicates, and uses scientific or technological information prior to the finalization of the updated policies under this section. (d) Within 60 days of the publication of the guidance prescribed in section 3(a), agency heads shall report to the OSTP Director on the actions taken to implement Gold Standard Science at their agency. Sec . 4 . Improving the Use, Interpretation, and Communication of Scientific Data . No later than 30 days after the date of this order, agency heads and employees shall adhere to the following rules governing the use, interpretation, and communication of scientific data, unless otherwise provided by law: (a) Employees shall not engage in scientific misconduct nor knowingly rely on information resulting from scientific misconduct. (b) Except as prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential business information, agency heads shall in a timely manner and, to the extent practicable and within the agency’s authority: (i) subject to paragraph (ii), make publicly available the following information within the agency’s possession: (A) the data, analyses, and conclusions associated with scientific and technological information produced or used by the agency that the agency reasonably assesses will have a clear and substantial effect on important public policies or important private sector decisions (influential scientific information), including data cited in peer-reviewed literature; and (B) the models and analyses (including, as applicable, the source code for such models) the agency used to generate such influential scientific information. Employees may not invoke exemption 5 to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) to prevent disclosure of such models unless authorized in writing to do so by the agency head following prior notice to the OSTP Director. (ii) risk models used to guide agency enforcement actions or select enforcement targets are not information that must be disclosed under this subsection. (c) When using scientific information in agency decision-making, employees shall transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties, including how uncertainty propagates throughout any models used in the analysis. (d) Where employees produce or use scientific information to inform policy or legal determinations they must use science that comports with the legal standards applicable to those determinations, including when agencies evaluate the realistic or reasonably foreseeable effects of an action. (e) Employees shall be transparent about the likelihood of the assumptions and scenarios used. Highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency’s action. (f) When scientific or technological information is used to inform agency evaluations and subsequent decision-making, employees shall apply a “weight of scientific evidence” approach. (g) Employees’ communication of scientific information shall be consistent with the results of the relevant analysis and evaluation and, to the extent that uncertainty is present, the degree of uncertainty should be communicated. Communications involving a scientific model or information derived from a scientific model should include reference to any material assumptions that inform the model’s outputs. (h) Once the guidance on Gold Standard Science is established and promulgated pursuant to section 3 of this order, it shall, among other things, form the basis for employees’ evaluation of all scientific and technological information called for in this order except where otherwise required by law.

For decades, the USBP has maintained the thin line between order and chaos.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the last administration &#8212; in an extraordinary act of deception and betrayal, imported an army of unvetted illegal aliens, including violent criminals, thugs, gang members, and terrorists from the darkest and most dangerous parts of the world.&nbsp; Their arrival over the last 4 years ushered in record-shattering levels of immigrants illegally coming into our country while at the same time depleting resources and draining the morale of our incredible USBP agents. The tide turned on January 20, 2025.&nbsp; One of my first actions as President was declaring a National Emergency at the southern border of the United States, which provided additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government&#8217;s response to the crisis.&nbsp; I also designated cartels and other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, as foreign terrorist organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists in order to end their campaign of violence and bloodshed on our homeland.&nbsp; Additionally, I have resumed our border wall construction, reinstated the Remain in Mexico policy, halted the practice of catch-and-release, ended asylum for illegal border crossers, deployed thousands of American soldiers to defend and protect our borders, and implemented the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Within my first 100 days in office, daily border encounters dropped 95 percent, and migrant crossings declined by an astounding 99.99 percent.&nbsp; In March, our Nation saw the lowest monthly number of border encounters in recorded history &#8212; and fentanyl traffic fell by 54 percent compared to March of the previous year.&nbsp; Also in my first 100 days, my Administration arrested more than 150,000 and deported more than 135,000 illegal aliens.&nbsp; Under my leadership, our USBP agents are not only receiving the resources they need to do their job but also the respect they have earned and deserve &#8212; and our work is only just beginning.

Every day, Border Patrol agents selflessly risk their lives to repel the flow of deadly drugs, weapons, criminals, and terrorists — many of whom come to our shores from jails, prisons, and mental institutions in far-flung countries across the globe. On this anniversary of the United States Border Patrol, we honor every agent for their honorable service and pledge to support them in their mission to keep Americans safe. For decades, the USBP has maintained the thin line between order and chaos. Unfortunately, the last administration — in an extraordinary act of deception and betrayal, imported an army of unvetted illegal aliens, including violent criminals, thugs, gang members, and terrorists from the darkest and most dangerous parts of the world. Their arrival over the last 4 years ushered in record-shattering levels of immigrants illegally coming into our country while at the same time depleting resources and draining the morale of our incredible USBP agents. The tide turned on January 20, 2025. One of my first actions as President was declaring a National Emergency at the southern border of the United States, which provided additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government’s response to the crisis. I also designated cartels and other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, as foreign terrorist organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists in order to end their campaign of violence and bloodshed on our homeland. Additionally, I have resumed our border wall construction, reinstated the Remain in Mexico policy, halted the practice of catch-and-release, ended asylum for illegal border crossers, deployed thousands of American soldiers to defend and protect our borders, and implemented the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Within my first 100 days in office, daily border encounters dropped 95 percent, and migrant crossings declined by an astounding 99.99 percent. In March, our Nation saw the lowest monthly number of border encounters in recorded history — and fentanyl traffic fell by 54 percent compared to March of the previous year. Also in my first 100 days, my Administration arrested more than 150,000 and deported more than 135,000 illegal aliens. Under my leadership, our USBP agents are not only receiving the resources they need to do their job but also the respect they have earned and deserve — and our work is only just beginning. As we celebrate 101 years of the USBP, we honor the thousands of patriots who dedicate their careers to defending our borders and upholding the rule of law, even in the face of grave danger and tremendous risk. Above all, we pay tribute to every brave soul who has perished in the line of duty while proudly serving our Nation. In their memory, and in honor of their beloved family members, we pledge to empower the USBP to safeguard the American homeland today, tomorrow, and beyond. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

(b) &nbsp;The Administrator of the FAA, under the supervision of the Secretary of Transportation and in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall seek to secure bilateral aviation safety agreements with foreign aviation authorities as necessary for the safe international operation of supersonic aircraft. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Federal Aviation Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

But criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign actors have intensified their weaponization of these technologies, creating new and serious threats to our homeland. Drug cartels use UAS to smuggle fentanyl across our borders, deliver contraband into prisons, surveil law enforcement, and otherwise endanger the public. Mass gatherings are vulnerable to disruptions and threats by unauthorized UAS flights. Critical infrastructure, including military bases, is subject to frequent &#8212; and often unidentified &#8212; UAS incursions. Immediate action is needed to ensure American sovereignty over its skies and that its airspace remains safe and secure. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &nbsp;the term &#8220;unmanned aircraft systems&#8221; or &#8220;UAS&#8221; has the meaning given in 49 U.S.C. 44801; (b) &nbsp;the term &#8220;critical infrastructure&#8221; has the meaning given in 42 U.S.C. 5195c(e), and includes systems and assets in all of the designated critical infrastructure sectors identified in National Security Memorandum 22 of April 30, 2024 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience) (NSM-22); and (c) &nbsp;the term Sector Risk Management Agency or &#8220;SRMA&#8221; has the same meaning given in 6 U.S.C. 650 and as further described in NSM-22.

Sec . 4 . Task Force to Restore American Airspace Sovereignty . To assist in ensuring control over our national airspace, there is hereby established the Federal Task Force to Restore American Airspace Sovereignty (Task Force). The Task Force shall be chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) or a designee, and include principals, or their designees, from appropriate executive departments and agencies as identified by the APNSA. The Task Force shall review relevant operational, technical, and regulatory frameworks and develop and propose solutions to UAS threats, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and shall make recommendations on the implementation of all actions identified in this order. Sec . 5 . Airspace Regulations to Protect the Public . The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall: (a) &nbsp;with respect to the rulemaking required by section&nbsp;2209(f) of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016, as amended: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;promptly submit a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Task Force establishing the statutorily required process for restricting drone flights over fixed site facilities, and interpreting, to the extent appropriate, critical infrastructure consistent with the definition of that term in this order; and (ii) &nbsp;promulgate a final rule as soon as practicable after publication of the NPRM; (b) &nbsp;make national security and homeland security assessments under section 2209 in coordination with Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs), the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Attorney General, as appropriate, and whenever military installations or operations are implicated, with the Secretary of Defense; and (c) &nbsp;within 180 days of the date of this order, make freely available online Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) in an open format easily accepted for drone geofencing and Aircraft Navigation and Guidance system purposes.&nbsp; This online availability should supplement, but not replace, existing NOTAMs and TFR promulgation methods. Sec . 6 . Enhancing Airspace Sovereignty . (a) the Attorney General, in coordination with the Administrator of the FAA, shall take appropriate steps to ensure full enforcement of applicable civil and criminal laws when drone operators endanger the public, violate established airspace restrictions, or operate a drone in furtherance of an element of another crime; (b) &nbsp;on a recurring basis, the Attorney General shall submit to the President, through the APNSA, legislative proposals that would revise criminal penalties for violations of restricted airspace; and (c) &nbsp;within 30 days of the date of this order, and to the extent allowed by law, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that their respective departments&#8217; grant programs permit otherwise eligible State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) agencies to receive grants to purchase UAS or equipment or services for the detection, tracking, or identification of drones and drone signals, consistent with the legal authorities of those SLTTs. Sec . 7 . Detection, Tracking, and Identification of Drones and Drone Signals . (a) To the extent permitted by law and consistent with the Fourth Amendment, executive departments and agencies shall use all available existing authorities to employ equipment to detect, track, and identify drones and drone signals.

(c) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the FAA shall provide, to the extent permitted by law, including the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), automated real-time access to personal identifying information associated with UAS remote identification signals to appropriate executive departments and agencies and SLTT agencies for the purposes of enforcing applicable Federal or State law, with appropriate national security and privacy safeguards. (d) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of the FAA, in coordination with the heads of other SRMAs as appropriate, shall publish guidance to aid private critical infrastructure owners or operators in employing technologies to detect, track, and identify drones and drone signals. Sec . 8 . Enhancing General Protections . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation, shall submit a recommendation to the President, through the APNSA, using risk-based assessment as defined in 6 U.S.C. 124n(k)(8), on whether the northern and southern land borders; large airports; Federal facilities; critical infrastructure; and military installations, facilities, and assets should be designated as covered facilities or assets under 6 U.S.C. 124n and 10 U.S.C. 130i and whether any changes to law would be necessary relating to such designation. Sec . 9 . Building Counter-UAS Capacity . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall explore integrating counter-UAS operational responses as part of Joint Terrorism Task Forces for the purpose of protecting mass gathering events.

The Medicaid program was designed to be a program to compassionately provide taxpayer dollars to healthcare providers who offer care to the most vulnerable Americans. To keep payments reasonable, billable costs for such care were historically capped at the same level that healthcare providers could receive from Medicare. The State and Federal Governments jointly shared this cost burden to ensure those of lesser means did not go untreated. Under the Biden Administration, States and healthcare providers were permitted to game the system. For example, States &quot;taxed&quot; healthcare providers, but sent the same money back to them in the form of a &quot;Medicaid payment,&quot; which automatically unlocked for healthcare providers an additional &quot;burden-sharing&quot; payment from the Federal Government. Through this gimmick, the State could avoid contributing money toward Medicaid services, meaning the State no longer had a reason to be prudent in the amount of reimbursement provided. Instead of paying Medicare rates, many States that utilize these arrangements now pay the same healthcare providers almost three times the Medicare amount, a practice encouraged by the Biden Administration. These State Directed Payments have rapidly accelerated, quadrupling in magnitude over the last 4 years and reaching $110 billion in 2024 alone. This trajectory threatens the Federal Treasury and Medicaid&#039;s long-term stability, and the imbalance between Medicaid and Medicare patients threatens to jeopardize access to care for our seniors. I pledged to protect and improve these important Government healthcare programs for those that rely on them. Seniors on Medicare and Medicaid recipients both deserve access to quality care in a system free from the fraud, waste, and abuse, that enriches the unscrupulous and jeopardizes the programs themselves. We will take action to continue to love and cherish the Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure they are preserved for those who need them most. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall therefore take appropriate action to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, including by ensuring Medicaid payments rates are not higher than Medicare, to the extent permitted by applicable law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

My Administration is committed to protecting the American people from radical green agenda policies that make their lives more expensive, and to maximizing the beneficial uses of our existing energy infrastructure and natural resources to generate energy and lower the cost of living. The Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023 (Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin), for example, elevates &#8220;equitable treatment for fish&#8221; and misplaced concerns about climate change above the Nation&#8217;s interests in reliable energy resources and the needs of American citizens. Among other things, the actions that the Biden Administration contemplated in furtherance of the policy stated in the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, included breaching four dams on the Lower Snake River, eliminating over 3,000 megawatts of secure, reliable, and affordable hydroelectric generating capacity. The negative impacts from these reckless acts, if completed, would be devastating for the region, and there would be no viable approach to replace the low-cost, baseload energy supplied; the critical shipping channels lost; the vital water supply for local farmers reduced; or the recreational opportunities that would no longer be possible as a result of these acts. To prevent these harmful impacts, I hereby revoke the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023. Further, within 15 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works under the direction of the Secretary of the Army (heads of departments) shall take all appropriate steps to withdraw from the Memorandum of Understanding filed on December 14, 2023, in the Columbia River System litigation, National Wildlife Federation v. National Marine Fisheries Service , 3:01-cv-640-SI (D. Or.), Dkt. 2450-1 (MOU). The heads of departments shall also rescind the &#8220;Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Columbia River System Operations&#8221; published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024. As appropriate, the heads of departments shall develop a schedule to complete the Supplemental Columbia River System Environmental Impact Statement and reissue the Notice of Intent pursuant to that schedule and in alignment with any updated National Environmental Policy Act procedures of the heads of departments. The heads of departments shall submit the schedule to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Chair shall convene regular meetings among the heads of departments and any additional appropriate Federal stakeholders for updates on the status of the environmental review process. Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the heads of departments shall identify and report to the President through the Chair of CEQ on: (i) all actions taken pursuant to or consistent with the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, including the MOU; (ii) the status of all Federal commitments made pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, and the MOU along with an identification of any such commitments that may be consistent with the policies of my Administration; (iii) any steps that may be taken to rescind or recoup Federal funds obligated to implement the MOU; and (iv) any actions that have been taken and future steps that must be taken to withdraw from the MOU.

Purpose . The devastation of the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires shocked the American people and highlighted the catastrophic consequences when State and local governments are unable to quickly respond to such disasters. In too many cases, including in California, a slow and inadequate response to wildfires is a direct result of reckless mismanagement and lack of preparedness. Wildfires threaten every region, yet many local government entities continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures. Firefighters across the country are forced to rely on outdated technology and face challenges in quickly responding to wildfires because of unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy. The Federal Government can empower State and local leaders by streamlining Federal wildfire capabilities to improve their effectiveness and promoting commonsense, technology-enabled local strategies for land management and wildfire response and mitigation. Sec . 2 . Streamlining Federal Wildland Fire Governance . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall, to the maximum degree practicable and consistent with applicable law, consolidate their wildland fire programs to achieve the most efficient and effective use of wildland fire offices, coordinating bodies, programs, budgets, procurement processes, and research and, as necessary, recommend additional measures to advance this objective. Sec . 3 . Encouraging Local Wildfire Preparedness and Response . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall: (i) expand and strengthen the use of partnerships, agreements, compacts, and mutual aid capabilities that empower Federal, State, local, tribal, and community-driven land management that reduces wildfire risk and improves wildfire response, including on public lands; and (ii) develop and expand the use of other measures to incentivize responsible land management and wildfire prevention, mitigation, and response measures at the State and local levels. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) represented at the National Interagency Fire Center, shall: (i) develop a comprehensive technology roadmap, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), to increase wildfire firefighting capabilities at the State and local levels, including through artificial intelligence, data sharing, innovative modeling and mapping capabilities, and technology to identify wildland fire ignitions and weather forecasts to inform response and evacuation; and (ii) promote the use of a risk-informed approach, as consistent with Executive Order 14239 of March 18, 2025 (Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness), to develop new policies that remove barriers to preventing and responding to wildfires, including through year-round response readiness, better forest health, and activities outlined in Executive Order 14225 of March 1, 2025 (Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production). Sec . 4 . Strengthening Wildfire Mitigation . Within 90 days of the date of this order: (a) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with applicable law, Federal rules or policies that impede the use of appropriate, preventative prescribed fires. (b) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with applicable law, Federal rules or policies hindering the appropriate use of fire retardant to fight wildfires. (c) The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall consider promoting, assisting, and facilitating, as consistent with applicable law, innovative uses of woody biomass and forest products to reduce fuel loads in areas at risk of wildfires. (d) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall consider initiating rulemaking proceedings to establish, as consistent with applicable law, best practices to reduce the risk of wildfire ignition from the bulk-power system without increasing costs for electric-power end users, including through methods such as vegetation management, the removal of forest-hazardous fuels along transmission lines, improved engineering approaches, and safer operational practices. (e) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, shall review pending and proposed wildfire-related litigation involving electrical utility companies to ensure the Department&#8217;s positions and proposed resolutions in such matters advance the wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts identified in this order. Sec . 5 . Modernizing Wildfire Prevention and Response . (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of OSTP, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the heads of relevant agencies, shall, as appropriate, identify, declassify, and make publicly available historical satellite datasets that will advance wildfire prevention and response and improve wildfire prediction and evaluation models. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of agencies represented at the National Interagency Fire Center, shall: (i) Identify rules that impede wildfire prevention, detection, or response and consider eliminating or revising those rules, as consistent with applicable law. This consideration and any resulting rulemaking proceedings shall be reflected in the Fall 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda. (ii) Develop performance metrics for wildfire response, including metrics related to average response times, annual fuels treatments, safety and cost effectiveness, and other subjects, as appropriate for inclusion in strategic and annual performance plans. (c) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall evaluate and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the sale of excess aircraft and aircraft parts to support wildfire mitigation and response. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior in equal shares. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 12, 2025.

Review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States . (a) On March 14, 2024, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) received a voluntary notice describing the proposed acquisition by (1) Nippon Steel Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (Nippon Steel); (2) Nippon Steel North America, Inc., a New York corporation (Nippon Steel NA); and (3) 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Nippon Steel and Nippon Steel NA, the Purchasers), of United States Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (U.S. Steel, and such proposed acquisition, the Proposed Transaction). CFIUS subsequently initiated a review and investigation of the Proposed Transaction, which ultimately concluded with a referral to the President on December 23, 2024, for decision pursuant to section 721(d). (b) On January 3, 2025, pursuant to section 721(d)(1), then-President Biden issued an order titled &#8220;Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation&#8221; (January 3 Order), which prohibited the Proposed Transaction. (c) The statutory provision on which the January 3 Order was based authorizes the President to &#8220;take such action for such time as the President considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.&#8221; 50 U.S.C. 4565(d)(1). Consistent with that authority, section 3 of the January 3 Order reserved the President&#8217;s authority to issue further orders as &#8220;necessary to protect the national security of the United States.&#8221; (d) Pursuant to the authority referred to in subsection (c) of this section, and the President&#8217;s authority to reconsider prior actions, on April 7, 2025, I issued a Presidential Memorandum, entitled &#8220;Review of Proposed United States Steel Corporation Acquisition&#8221; (April 7 Memo), which directed CFIUS to conduct a de novo review of the Proposed Transaction to assist me in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate. (e) CFIUS submitted a recommendation to me on May 21, 2025, which, in accordance with the April 7 Memo, described CFIUS agency views regarding the risks to national security arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction, and included views on whether any measures proposed by U.S. Steel and the Purchasers are sufficient to mitigate those national security risks. The recommendation included a statement describing the position of each member agency of CFIUS, including the reasons for such position. Sec . 2 . Findings . (a) I hereby affirm the following findings, made initially in the January 3 Order: (i) there is credible evidence that leads me to believe that the Purchasers, through the Proposed Transaction, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (ii) provisions of law other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .) do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. (b) Based on the recommendation of and my review of the materials provided by CFIUS, including re-review of the prior assessment of risk, I additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met. Sec . 3 . Actions Ordered and Authorized . On the basis of the findings set forth in section 2 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection 721(f) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (a) Section 2(a) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows: &#8220;The Proposed Transaction, and any substantially similar transaction between the Purchasers and U.S. Steel, whether effected directly or indirectly by the Purchasers, through the Purchasers&#8217; shareholders or shareholders&#8217; immediate, intermediate, or ultimate foreign person beneficial owners, or through the Purchasers&#8217; partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, is prohibited, unless the Purchasers and U.S. Steel execute with the Department of the Treasury and any other appropriate member agencies of CFIUS, on or before the closing date of the Proposed Transaction, and remain in compliance thereafter with, a national security agreement (NSA) that is materially consistent, as so determined by the Department of the Treasury, with the draft NSA submitted to the Purchasers and U.S. Steel by the United States Government on June 13, 2025.&#8221; (b) Section 2(e) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows: &#8220;Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as the Purchasers and U.S. Steel have either abandoned the Proposed Transaction to the satisfaction of CFIUS or entered into the NSA referred to in subsection (a) of this section, CFIUS is further authorized to implement measures, including monitoring and enforcement measures, it deems necessary and appropriate with regard to the Proposed Transaction to protect the national security of the United States, including measures available to it under section 721 and its implementing regulations, which include the remedies available for violations of any order, agreement, or condition entered into or imposed under section 721.&#8221; (c) Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the January 3 Order are stricken. Sec . 4 . Reservation . I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to the Purchasers or U.S. Steel as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security of the United States. Sec . 5 . Publication and Transmittal . (a) This order shall be published in the Federal Register . (b) I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a copy of this order to the parties to the Proposed Transaction named in section 1 of this order. DONALD J.

Today, our Nation proudly celebrates 250 years of our Army&#8217;s strength, service, valor, and discipline. We honor its heroic legacy as the guardian of our sovereignty and our fortress against tyranny &#8212; and we pay tribute to the millions of warriors who live by the motto: This We&#8217;ll Defend. Following the first shots of the Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, it became clear to the patriots that &#8212; despite their persistent efforts for peace &#8212; war against the British was necessary as a final recourse in defense of their freedom. In the wake of the Boston Massacre, the Intolerable Acts, and the enduring injustice of taxation without representation, they established the First Continental Congress in the fall of 1774 to formally address their grievances. After dozens of patriots perished at Lexington and Concord, the Colonies reconvened &#8212; and by June 14, the delegates had decided that there was only one path forward. On that spring day, in a momentous act of unity and resolve, the Congress passed a resolution to formally establish the instrument of our national defense in the form of the Continental Army. &#8220;Resolved, that six companies of expert riflemen, be immediately raised in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, and two in Virginia&#8221; the resolution reads. With the passing of that fateful resolution, the scattered militias of the American Colonies banded together as a single force &#8212; boldly declaring that they would never waver in defense of their liberty and their home. The next day, George Washington was unanimously appointed as the Continental Army&#8217;s Commander-in-Chief. Weeks later, on July 3, 1775, he took charge of his Army in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &#8220;It is hoped that all Distinctions of Colonies will be laid aside so that one and the same Spirit may animate the whole, and the only Contest be, who shall render, on this great and trying occasion, the most essential service to the Great and common cause in which we are all engaged,&#8221; he wrote. In the days, weeks, and years that followed, that very same Army shocked the Redcoats at Trenton and Princeton, won their first great victory at Saratoga, secured the cause of independence at Yorktown, preserved the Union at Gettysburg, held the line at Chateau-Thierry, stormed the bloody beaches of Normandy, and to this day, gallantly defends our inheritance of freedom against every foe with unmatched tenacity, courage, and strength. What was first formed as a ragtag army of farmers, frontiersmen, blacksmiths, and merchants now stands as the most dominant military force ever born of human will &#8212; guided by the promise to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. To ensure our Army&#8217;s storied legacy continues well into the future, as President, I have purged the sinister ideology of &#8220;Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion&#8221; from the ranks of our military. I directed the Department of Defense to update its guidance regarding transgender &#8212; identifying medical standards to ensure our military remains the most lethal in the world. In a long overdue redress of injustice, I reinstated American service members who were dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, with full back pay and benefits. Every day, I am restoring a foreign policy of peace through strength &#8212; and as a result, military recruitment is soaring to historic highs. Under my leadership, the United States military will remain the mightiest, fiercest, boldest, and most revered in the entire world. On this 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army, we pay tribute to every legend of liberty who sacrificed their life to keep America safe, sovereign, and free. As my Administration continues the work of protecting our homeland and upholding our way of life, we proudly summon the spirit, confidence, and resolve of the intrepid men who won our independence on the battlefield 250 years ago &#8212; and we vow that their legacy of courage will never perish, and that our sacred birthright of freedom will never, ever die. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2025, as a day in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army.

The Border facilities herein described, and all aspects of their operation, shall be subject to all the conditions, provisions, and requirements of this permit and any subsequent Presidential amendment to it. The permittee shall make no substantial change in the Border facilities, in the location of the Border facilities, or in the operation authorized by this permit unless the President has approved the change in an amendment to this permit or in a new permit. Such substantial changes do not include, and the permittee may make, changes to the average daily throughput capacity of the Border facilities to any volume of products that is achievable through the Border facilities, and to the directional flow of any such products. Article 2 . The standards for, and the manner of, operation and maintenance of the Border facilities shall be subject to inspection by the representatives of appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. Officers and employees of such agencies who are duly authorized and performing their official duties shall be granted free and unrestricted access to the Border facilities by the permittee. The Border facilities, including the operation and maintenance of the Border facilities, shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations, including pipeline safety laws and regulations issued or administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The permittee shall obtain requisite permits from relevant State and local governmental entities, and relevant Federal agencies. Article 3 . Upon the termination, revocation, or surrender of this permit, unless otherwise decided by the President, the permittee, at its own expense, shall remove the Border facilities within such time as the President may specify. If the permittee fails to comply with an order to remove, or to take such other appropriate action with respect to, the Border facilities, the President may direct an appropriate official or agency to take possession of the Border facilities — or to remove the Border facilities or take other action — at the expense of the permittee. The permittee shall have no claim for damages caused by any such possession, removal, or other action. Article 4 . When, in the judgment of the President, ensuring the national security of the United States requires entering upon and taking possession of any of the Border facilities or parts thereof, and retaining possession, management, or control thereof for such a length of time as the President may deem necessary, the United States shall have the right to do so, provided that the President or his designee has given due notice to the permittee. The United States shall also have the right thereafter to restore possession and control to the permittee. In the event that the United States exercises the rights described in this article, it shall pay to the permittee just and fair compensation for the use of such Border facilities, upon the basis of a reasonable profit in normal conditions, and shall bear the cost of restoring the Border facilities to their previous condition, less the reasonable value of any improvements that may have been made by the United States. Article 5 . Any transfer of ownership or control of the Border facilities, or any part thereof, or any changes to the name of the permittee, shall be immediately communicated in writing to the President or his designee, and shall include information identifying any transferee. Notwithstanding any such transfers or changes, this permit shall remain in force subject to all of its conditions, permissions, and requirements, and any amendments thereto. Article 6 . (1) The permittee is responsible for acquiring any right-of-way grants or easements, permits, and other authorizations as may become necessary or appropriate. (2) The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the United States from any claimed or adjudged liability arising out of construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities, including environmental contamination from the release, threatened release, or discharge of hazardous substances or hazardous waste. (3) To ensure the safe operation of the Border facilities, the permittee shall maintain them and every part of them in a condition of good repair and in compliance with applicable law. Article 7 . The permittee shall file with the President or his designee, and with appropriate agencies, such sworn statements or reports with respect to the Border facilities, or the permittee’s activities and operations in connection therewith, as are now, or may hereafter, be required under any law or regulation of the United States Government or its agencies. These reporting obligations do not alter the intent that this permit be operative as a directive issued by the President alone. Article 8 . Upon request, the permittee shall provide appropriate information to the President or his designee with regard to the Border facilities. Such requests could include information concerning current conditions or anticipated changes in ownership or control, construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities. Article 9 . This permit is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.

Purpose . The United States is blessed with vast beautiful landscapes, abundant natural resources, and a rich heritage of discovery by travelers and outdoorsmen. America&#8217;s national parks, forests, waterways, and public lands have inspired generations and kindled our Nation&#8217;s spirit of exploration. To ensure that the next generation of Americans inherits this same sense of duty and adventure, my Administration will prioritize conserving our great American national parks and outdoor recreation areas. Years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach, and neglect of routine maintenance require action. Land-use restrictions have stripped hunters, fishers, hikers, and outdoorsmen of access to public lands that belong to them. These bureaucratic restrictions have undermined outdoor traditions and threatened conservation funding. The National Park Service and the United States Forest Service face more than $23 billion and $10.8 billion in deferred maintenance, respectively, leaving roads, trails, and historic landmarks in disrepair. Despite these challenges, our Nation has proven that conservation and economic growth go hand in hand. Since the signing of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law 116-152), the outdoor recreation economy has grown to $1.2 trillion in economic output, and, in 2023, comprised 3.1 percent of employees in the United States and supported 5 million jobs. Through both innovation and commonsense policies, America can preserve its natural beauty and expand outdoor recreation opportunities for future generations. It is the policy of my Administration to prioritize responsible conservation, restore our lands and waters, and protect our Nation&#8217;s outdoor heritage for the enjoyment of the American people. Sec . 2 . General Policies . All Federal land management agencies, as defined by 16 U.S.C. 6801(3), shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that their policies: (a) promote responsible stewardship of natural resources while driving economic growth; (b) expand access to public lands and waters for recreation, hunting, and fishing; (c) encourage responsible, voluntary conservation efforts; (d) cut bureaucratic delays that hinder effective environmental management; and (e) recover America&#8217;s fish and wildlife populations through proactive, voluntary, on-the-ground collaborative conservation efforts. Sec . 3 . Establishment and Composition of the President&#8217;s Make America Beautiful Again Commission . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Make America Beautiful Again Commission (Commission), which shall be chaired by the Secretary of the Interior (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director). (b) In addition to the Chair and the Executive Director, the Commission shall include the following officials or their designees: (i) the Secretary of Defense; (ii) the Secretary of Agriculture; (iii) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; (iv) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (v) the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; (vi) the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff; (vii) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; (viii) the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality; and (ix) other members of my Administration invited to participate, at the discretion of the Chair and the Executive Director. Sec . 4 . Conserving Our National Treasures. The Commission shall advise and assist the President regarding how best to responsibly conserve America&#8217;s national treasures and natural resources, including by: (a) monitoring the implementation of this order and facilitating interagency coordination on conservation efforts; (b) providing to the President actionable recommendations for improving conservation efforts; (c) developing policies to recover fish and wildlife populations through collaboration rather than regulation, including policies involving coordination with State wildlife agencies; (d) recommending to the President solutions to expand access to clean drinking water and restore aquatic ecosystems to improve water quality and availability; and (e) developing policies to expand access to public lands, national parks, national forests, and wildlife refuges while promoting a wide range of outdoor recreation opportunities like hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, skiing, climbing, boating, off-roading, and wildlife viewing. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of the Interior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose . For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar. The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation&#8217;s natural landscape. Moreover, reliance on so-called &#8220;green&#8221; subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries. Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to: (a) &nbsp;rapidly eliminate the market distortions and costs imposed on taxpayers by so-called &#8220;green&#8221; energy subsidies; (b) &nbsp;build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other &#8220;green&#8221; energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and (c) &nbsp;end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable &#8220;green&#8221; energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries. Sec . 3 . Tax Credits and One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Treasury . (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the &#8220;beginning of construction&#8221; are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built. (b) &nbsp;Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Sec . 4 . One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Interior . (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a review of regulations, guidance, policies, and practices under the Department of the Interior&#8217;s jurisdiction to determine whether any provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior shall then revise any identified regulations, guidance, policies, and practices as appropriate and consistent with applicable law to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar facilities. Sec . 5 . Reports . Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the findings made under, and actions taken and planned to be taken to implement, this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(a) The Executive Director (Executive Director) of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) may, within 30 days of the date that a project is identified to FPISC by a relevant agency, designate a Qualifying Project as a transparency project pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(b)(2)(A)(iii) and section 41003 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1312, 1747) (FAST-41). Within 30 days of receiving such agency notification, the Executive Director may publish Qualifying Projects on the Permitting Dashboard established under section 41003(b) of FAST-41, including schedules for expedited review. (b) In consultation with Project Sponsors, the Executive Director shall expedite the transition of eligible Qualifying Projects from transparency projects to FAST-41 “covered projects” as defined by 42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A). To the extent that a Qualifying Project does not meet the criteria set forth in 42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A)(i) or (iii), FPISC may consider all other available options to designate the project a covered project under 42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A)(iv). Sec . 7 . Streamlining of Permitting Review . (a) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall assist in expediting permitting on Federal and non-Federal lands by developing or modifying regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ); the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq .); the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. ); and other relevant applicable laws, in each case, that impact the development of Qualifying Projects. (b) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency’s statutory authorities, expeditiously identify Brownfield Sites and Superfund Sites for use by Qualifying Projects. As part of this effort, within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall develop guidance to help expedite environmental reviews for qualified reuse and assist State governments and private parties to return such Brownfield Sites and Superfund Sites to productive use as expeditiously as possible. Sec . 8 . Biological and Water Permitting Efficiencies . (a) Upon identification of sites by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy as described in section 9 of this order, the action agency, as identified through the process described in the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544) (ESA), shall initiate consultation under section 7 of the ESA with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or both with respect to common construction activities for Qualifying Projects that will occur over the next 10 years at a programmatic level.

(a) The Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy shall, after consultation with industry and further in consultation with the Department of Commerce as to the Project Sponsors to which relevant authorizations shall be granted, offer appropriate authorizations for sites identified by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Energy, as applicable and appropriate for the relevant uses, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 2201, 42 U.S.C. 7256, 43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq ., and all other applicable law. (b) The Secretary of Defense shall, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667 or other applicable law and as and when the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary or desirable, identify suitable sites on military installations for Covered Component infrastructure uses and competitively lease available lands for Qualifying Projects to support the Department of Defense’s energy, workforce, and mission needs, subject to security and force protection considerations. Sec . 10 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in how Americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and navigate their daily lives. Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; (DEI).&nbsp; In the AI context, DEI includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipulation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex.&nbsp; DEI displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable AI. For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical figures &#8212; including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings &#8212; when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements at the cost of accuracy.&nbsp; Another AI model refused to produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races.&nbsp; In yet another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not &#8220;misgender&#8221; another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse.&nbsp; While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of Federal procurement, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.&nbsp; Building on Executive Order 13960 of December 3, 2020 (Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government), this order helps fulfill that obligation in the context of large language models. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a)&nbsp; The term &#8220;agency&#8221; means an executive department, a military department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;agency head&#8221; means the highest-ranking official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors. (c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;LLM&#8221; means a large language model, which is a generative AI model trained on vast, diverse datasets that enable the model to generate natural-language responses to user prompts. (d) &nbsp;The term &#8220;national security system&#8221; has the same meaning as in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6). Sec . 3 . Unbiased AI Principles . It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of trustworthy AI. To advance that policy, agency heads shall, consistent with applicable law and in consideration of guidance issued pursuant to section 4 of this order, procure only those LLMs developed in accordance with the following two principles (Unbiased AI Principles): (a) Truth-seeking. LLMs shall be truthful in responding to user prompts seeking factual information or analysis. LLMs shall prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete or contradictory. (b)&nbsp; Ideological Neutrality.&nbsp; LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.&nbsp; Developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments into an LLM&#8217;s outputs unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise readily accessible to the end user.&nbsp; Sec . 4 . Implementation . (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Administrator of General Services, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall issue guidance to agencies to implement section 3 of this order. That guidance shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account for technical limitations in complying with this order; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;permit vendors to comply with the requirement in the second Unbiased AI Principle to be transparent about ideological judgments through disclosure of the LLM&#8217;s system prompt, specifications, evaluations, or other relevant documentation, and avoid requiring disclosure of specific model weights or other sensitive technical data where practicable; (iii) &nbsp;avoid over-prescription and afford latitude for vendors to comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and take different approaches to innovation; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;specify factors for agency heads to consider in determining whether to apply the Unbiased AI Principles to LLMs developed by the agencies and to AI models other than LLMs; and (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make exceptions as appropriate for the use of LLMs in national security systems. (b)&nbsp; Each agency head shall, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include in each Federal contract for an LLM entered into following the date of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section terms requiring that the procured LLM comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and providing that decommissioning costs shall be charged to the vendor in the event of termination by the agency for the vendor&#8217;s noncompliance with the contract following a reasonable period to cure; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;to the extent practicable and consistent with contract terms, revise existing contracts for LLMs to include the terms specified in subsection (b)(i) of this section; and (iii) &nbsp;within 90 days of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section, adopt procedures to ensure that LLMs procured by the agency comply with the Unbiased AI Principles. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) &nbsp;The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the General Services Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Another AI model refused to produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races. In yet another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not “misgender” another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse. While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of Federal procurement, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.

Purpose and Policy . Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe. The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the last year of the previous administration &#8212; 274,224 &#8212; was the highest ever recorded. The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both. Nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes. An equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions. The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats. Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order.&nbsp; Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens.&nbsp; My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety. Sec . 2 . Restoring Civil Commitment . (a) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States&#8217; policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time; and (ii) &nbsp;provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and &#8220;step-down&#8221; treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves. Sec . 3 . Fighting Vagrancy on America&#8217;s Streets . (a) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by law: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; (iii) &nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (v)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders. (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes are evaluated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they are sexually dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to support, as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 et seq ., encampment removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and State and local resources are inadequate; (iii) &nbsp;assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal jails or hospitals; and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive funding from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply. Sec . 4 . Redirecting Federal Resources Toward Effective Methods of Addressing Homelessness . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate action to: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called &#8220;harm reduction&#8221; or &#8220;safe consumption&#8221; efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support networks; and (iii) &nbsp;ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for which such diversion serves public safety. Sec . 5 . Increasing Accountability and Safety in America&#8217;s Homelessness Programs . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate actions to increase accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and transitional living programs. These actions shall include, to the extent permitted by law, ending support for &#8220;housing first&#8221; policies that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees through broadening the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as appropriate, take steps to require recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance to increase requirements that persons participating in the recipients&#8217; programs who suffer from substance use disorder or serious mental illness use substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation. (c) &nbsp;With respect to recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance that operate drug injection sites or &#8220;safe consumption sites,&#8221; knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or distribution of illicit drugs on property under their control: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the Attorney General shall review whether such recipients are in violation of Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 856, and bring civil or criminal actions in appropriate cases; and (ii)&nbsp; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall review whether such recipients are in violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive Federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance as appropriate. (d) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where permissible under applicable law, federally funded programs to exclusively house women and children and to stop sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance through such programs from being housed with unrelated children.&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;allow or require the recipients of Federal funding for homelessness assistance to collect health-related information that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development identifies as necessary to the effective and efficient operation of the funding program from all persons to whom such assistance is provided; and (ii) &nbsp;require those funding recipients to share such data with law enforcement authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the collected health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals with mental health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health resources. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) &nbsp;The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe. The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the last year of the previous administration — 274,224 — was the highest ever recorded. The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both. Nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes. An equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions. The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats. Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order. Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety. Sec . 2 . Restoring Civil Commitment . (a) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time; and (ii) provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and “step-down” treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves. Sec . 3 . Fighting Vagrancy on America’s Streets . (a) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by law: (i) enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; (ii) enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; (iii) enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; (iv) enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (v) substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders. (b) The Attorney General shall: (i) ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes are evaluated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they are sexually dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment; (ii) take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to support, as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 et seq ., encampment removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and State and local resources are inadequate; (iii) assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal jails or hospitals; and (iv) enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive funding from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply. Sec . 4 . Redirecting Federal Resources Toward Effective Methods of Addressing Homelessness . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate action to: (i) ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called “harm reduction” or “safe consumption” efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm; (ii) provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support networks; and (iii) ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. (b) The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for which such diversion serves public safety. Sec . 5 . Increasing Accountability and Safety in America’s Homelessness Programs . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate actions to increase accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and transitional living programs.

(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as appropriate, take steps to require recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance to increase requirements that persons participating in the recipients’ programs who suffer from substance use disorder or serious mental illness use substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation. (c) With respect to recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance that operate drug injection sites or “safe consumption sites,” knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or distribution of illicit drugs on property under their control: (i) the Attorney General shall review whether such recipients are in violation of Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 856, and bring civil or criminal actions in appropriate cases; and (ii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall review whether such recipients are in violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive Federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance as appropriate. (d) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where permissible under applicable law, federally funded programs to exclusively house women and children and to stop sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance through such programs from being housed with unrelated children. (e) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law: (i) allow or require the recipients of Federal funding for homelessness assistance to collect health-related information that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development identifies as necessary to the effective and efficient operation of the funding program from all persons to whom such assistance is provided; and (ii) require those funding recipients to share such data with law enforcement authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the collected health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals with mental health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health resources.

A PROCLAMATION 1.&nbsp; On June 30, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of copper in all forms (copper), including copper ores, copper concentrates, refined copper, copper alloys, scrap copper, and derivative products, on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section 232).&nbsp; Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and&nbsp;advised me of his opinion that copper is being imported into&nbsp;the&nbsp;United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as&nbsp;to threaten to impair the national security of&nbsp;the United States. 2.&nbsp; The Secretary found that the present quantities of copper imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing copper are weakening our economy, resulting in the&nbsp;persistent threat of further closures of domestic copper production facilities and the shrinking of our ability to meet national security production requirements.&nbsp; Because of these risks, and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security and other relevant factors,&nbsp; see&nbsp; 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of copper imports threaten to impair the national security as provided in&nbsp;section 232. 3.&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary found that copper is essential to the manufacturing foundation on which United States national and economic security depend.&nbsp; Copper is the second most widely used material by the Department of Defense and is a necessary input in a range of defense systems, including aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, submarines, missiles, and ammunition.&nbsp; Copper also plays a central role in the broader United States industrial base.&nbsp; The metal&#8217;s exceptional electrical conductivity and durability also make it indispensable to critical infrastructure sectors that support the American economy, national security, and public health.&nbsp; Alternatives to copper are insufficient substitutes for these vital industries and products in many circumstances. 4.&nbsp; The Secretary found that the United States was a world leader across the value chain of copper production (mining, refining, semi-finished goods, and finished goods containing copper) for most of the 20th century.&nbsp; But despite copper being a crucial material in manufacturing and for the national and economic security of the United States, United States copper production has plummeted.&nbsp; Today, a single foreign country dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. 5.&nbsp; The Secretary found that unfair trade practices abroad, exacerbated by overly burdensome environmental regulations at home, have hollowed out United States copper refining and smelting, caused the United States to be overly reliant on foreign copper imports, and prevent a path forward without strong corrective action.&nbsp; Foreign competitors leverage state subsidies and overproduction to flood international markets with artificially low-priced copper products, driving United States producers out of business.&nbsp; The United States is now dangerously dependent on foreign imports of semi-finished copper, intensive copper derivative products, and copper-containing products, and imbalances in the global markets make domestic investment increasingly unviable. 6.&nbsp; The Secretary found that United States dependency on foreign sources of copper is a national security vulnerability that could be exploited by foreign countries, weakens United States industrial resilience, exposes the American people to supply chain disruptions, economic instability, and strategic vulnerabilities, and jeopardizes the United States defense industrial base.&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a&nbsp;range of actions to adjust the imports of copper so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security.&nbsp; For example, the Secretary recommended an immediate universal 30&nbsp;percent import duty on semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products.&nbsp; The Secretary also recommended a phased universal tariff on refined copper of 15&nbsp;percent starting in 2027 and 30 percent starting in 2028.&nbsp; The Secretary further recommended a domestic sales requirement for copper input materials starting at 25 percent in 2027, a domestic sales requirement of 25 percent for high-quality copper scrap, and export controls for high-quality copper scrap.&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; After considering the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I concur with the Secretary&#8217;s finding that copper is being imported into the United States in quantities and under circumstances that threaten to impair the national security of the United States.&nbsp; In my judgment, and in light of the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I also determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose tariffs, as described below, to adjust imports of copper and its derivatives so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 9.&nbsp; To ensure that the tariffs on copper in this proclamation are not circumvented and that the purpose of this action to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of copper is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to set up a process to identify and impose tariffs on certain derivatives of copper, as further described below. 10.&nbsp; In my judgment, the action in this proclamation will,&nbsp;among other things, help increase domestic production of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, thereby reducing our Nation&#8217;s reliance on foreign sources.&nbsp; It will ensure that domestic fabricators are able to supply sufficient quantities of copper products essential for infrastructure, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; This action will also promote investment, employment, and innovation in the domestic copper fabrication sector, strengthen supply chains, enhance industrial resilience, and generate meaningful economic benefits.&nbsp; This action will adjust the imports of semi-finished copper products, intensive copper derivative products, and certain other copper derivatives and is necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of such articles. 11.&nbsp; Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security.&nbsp; 12.&nbsp; Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19&nbsp;U.S.C. 2483, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 13.&nbsp; Consistent with the General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (May 8, 2025), the United States intends to coordinate with the United Kingdom to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing the national security threat in the copper sector. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232; the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701&nbsp; et seq .); section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. 4511; section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1)&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation, shall be subject to a 50 percent tariff.&nbsp; This tariff shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025, and shall continue in effect, unless such action is expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.&nbsp; This tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, unless stated otherwise below. (2)&nbsp; The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register &nbsp;if needed.

On June 30, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of copper in all forms (copper), including copper ores, copper concentrates, refined copper, copper alloys, scrap copper, and derivative products, on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section 232). Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that copper is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. The Secretary found that the present quantities of copper imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing copper are weakening our economy, resulting in the persistent threat of further closures of domestic copper production facilities and the shrinking of our ability to meet national security production requirements. Because of these risks, and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security and other relevant factors, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of copper imports threaten to impair the national security as provided in section 232. 3. In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary found that copper is essential to the manufacturing foundation on which United States national and economic security depend. Copper is the second most widely used material by the Department of Defense and is a necessary input in a range of defense systems, including aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, submarines, missiles, and ammunition. Copper also plays a central role in the broader United States industrial base. The metal’s exceptional electrical conductivity and durability also make it indispensable to critical infrastructure sectors that support the American economy, national security, and public health. Alternatives to copper are insufficient substitutes for these vital industries and products in many circumstances. 4. The Secretary found that the United States was a world leader across the value chain of copper production (mining, refining, semi-finished goods, and finished goods containing copper) for most of the 20th century. But despite copper being a crucial material in manufacturing and for the national and economic security of the United States, United States copper production has plummeted. Today, a single foreign country dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. 5. The Secretary found that unfair trade practices abroad, exacerbated by overly burdensome environmental regulations at home, have hollowed out United States copper refining and smelting, caused the United States to be overly reliant on foreign copper imports, and prevent a path forward without strong corrective action. Foreign competitors leverage state subsidies and overproduction to flood international markets with artificially low-priced copper products, driving United States producers out of business. The United States is now dangerously dependent on foreign imports of semi-finished copper, intensive copper derivative products, and copper-containing products, and imbalances in the global markets make domestic investment increasingly unviable. 6. The Secretary found that United States dependency on foreign sources of copper is a national security vulnerability that could be exploited by foreign countries, weakens United States industrial resilience, exposes the American people to supply chain disruptions, economic instability, and strategic vulnerabilities, and jeopardizes the United States defense industrial base. 7. In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a range of actions to adjust the imports of copper so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. For example, the Secretary recommended an immediate universal 30 percent import duty on semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. The Secretary also recommended a phased universal tariff on refined copper of 15 percent starting in 2027 and 30 percent starting in 2028. The Secretary further recommended a domestic sales requirement for copper input materials starting at 25 percent in 2027, a domestic sales requirement of 25 percent for high-quality copper scrap, and export controls for high-quality copper scrap. 8. After considering the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I concur with the Secretary’s finding that copper is being imported into the United States in quantities and under circumstances that threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In my judgment, and in light of the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I also determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose tariffs, as described below, to adjust imports of copper and its derivatives so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 9. To ensure that the tariffs on copper in this proclamation are not circumvented and that the purpose of this action to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of copper is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to set up a process to identify and impose tariffs on certain derivatives of copper, as further described below. 10. In my judgment, the action in this proclamation will, among other things, help increase domestic production of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, thereby reducing our Nation’s reliance on foreign sources. It will ensure that domestic fabricators are able to supply sufficient quantities of copper products essential for infrastructure, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing. This action will also promote investment, employment, and innovation in the domestic copper fabrication sector, strengthen supply chains, enhance industrial resilience, and generate meaningful economic benefits. This action will adjust the imports of semi-finished copper products, intensive copper derivative products, and certain other copper derivatives and is necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of such articles. 11. Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. 12. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 13. Consistent with the General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (May 8, 2025), the United States intends to coordinate with the United Kingdom to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing the national security threat in the copper sector. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232; the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .); section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. 4511; section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation, shall be subject to a 50 percent tariff. This tariff shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025, and shall continue in effect, unless such action is expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. This tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, unless stated otherwise below. (2) The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register if needed. (3) Within 90 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall establish a process for including additional derivative copper articles within the scope of the duties of this proclamation, consistent with the processes established pursuant to Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States) and Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States). (4) The non-copper content of all copper articles subject to this proclamation shall be subject to tariffs pursuant to Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), and any other applicable duties, including those imposed by Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended, Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended, and Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), as amended. The additional duties described in clauses 1 through 3 of this proclamation shall apply only to the copper content of articles subject to this proclamation. CBP shall issue authoritative guidance mandating strict compliance with declaration requirements for copper content in imported articles and outlining maximum penalties for noncompliance, including that importers who submit underreported declarations may be subject to severe consequences, such as significant monetary penalties, loss of import privileges, and criminal liability, consistent with United States law. (5) If any product is subject to tariffs under both this proclamation and Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the product shall be subject to the duties imposed pursuant to Proclamation 10908, as amended, and not those imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (6) Any product described in clause 1 of this proclamation, except those eligible for admission as “domestic status” as described in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to a duty imposed by this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation must be admitted as “privileged foreign” status as described in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. (7) The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of copper and its derivatives. The Secretary shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of copper and copper derivative imports with respect to national security. The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232. By June 30, 2026, the Secretary shall provide the President with an update on domestic copper markets, including refining capacity and the market for refined copper in the United States, so that the President may determine whether imposing a phased universal import duty on refined copper of 15 percent starting on January 1, 2027, and 30 percent starting on January 1, 2028, as recommended by the June 30, 2025, report, is warranted to ensure that copper imports do not continue to threaten to impair the national security. The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate that the duty rate provided for in this proclamation, or any actions modifying this proclamation, is no longer necessary. (8) Separately, I find that copper input materials and high-quality copper scrap meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the DPA, 50 U.S.C. 4511(b). Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Secretary in Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the Secretary shall take all appropriate action to implement the domestic sales requirements that he recommended in the June 30, 2025, report. (9) The Secretary may issue regulations, rules, guidance, and procedures consistent with the purpose of this proclamation, including to address operational necessity. (10) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (11) CBP may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the tariff imposed by this proclamation. (12) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. If any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

National Emergency . As President of the United States, my highest duty is protecting the national security, foreign policy, and economy of this country. Recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Members of the Government of Brazil have taken actions that interfere with the economy of the United States, infringe the free expression rights of United States persons, violate human rights, and undermine the interest the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies. Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically persecuting a former President of Brazil, which is contributing to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented actions that harm and are a threat to the economy of the United States, conflict with and threaten the policy of the United States to promote free speech and free and fair elections at home and abroad, and violate fundamental human rights.&nbsp; Indeed, certain Brazilian officials have issued orders to compel United States online platforms to censor the accounts or content of United States persons, where such accounts or content are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution within the United States; block the ability of United States persons to raise money on their platforms; change their content moderation policies, enforcement practices, or algorithms in ways that may result in the censorship of the content and accounts of United States persons; and provide the user data of accounts belonging to United States persons, facilitating the targeting of political critics in the United States.&nbsp; For example, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to target political opponents, shield corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other Brazilian officials.&nbsp; Justice de Moraes has authorized politically motivated police raids, arrests, and bank account freezes.&nbsp; He has also authorized the&nbsp;confiscation of passports, jailed individuals without trial&nbsp;for social media posts, opened unprecedented criminal investigations, including into United States citizens for their constitutionally protected speech in the United States, and issued secret orders to United States social media companies to censor thousands of posts and de-platform dozens of political critics, including United States persons, for lawful speech on United States soil.&nbsp; When United States and United States-headquartered companies have refused to comply with his unlawful censorship demands, Justice de Moraes has imposed substantial fines on United States and United States-headquartered companies, ordered the suspension of United States and United States-headquartered companies in Brazil, and threatened United States and United States-headquartered company executives with criminal prosecution.&nbsp; In fact, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing the Government of Brazil&#8217;s criminal prosecution of&nbsp;a&nbsp;United States resident for speech he made on United&nbsp;States soil. These judicial actions, taken under the pretext of combatting &#8220;disinformation,&#8221; &#8220;fake news,&#8221; or &#8220;anti-democratic&#8221; or &#8220;hateful&#8221; content, endanger the economy of the United States by tyrannically and arbitrarily coercing United States companies to censor political speech, turn over sensitive United States user data, or change their content moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. &nbsp;These actions also chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United&nbsp;States has in protecting its citizens and companies at&nbsp;home and abroad.&nbsp; Brazilian officials are also persecuting former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. &nbsp;The Government of Brazil has unjustly charged Bolsonaro with multiple crimes related to Bolsonaro&#8217;s 2022 runoff election, and the Supreme Court of Brazil has misguidedly ruled that Bolsonaro must stand trial for these unjustified criminal charges.&nbsp; Political persecution, through drummed up prosecutions, threatens the orderly development of Brazil&#8217;s political, administrative, and economic institutions, including undermining the ability of Brazil to hold a free and fair election of the presidency in 2026.&nbsp; The Government of Brazil&#8217;s treatment of former President Bolsonaro also contributes to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. I find that the unprecedented actions taken by the Government of Brazil have violated the free expression rights of United States persons, interfered with the economy of the United States by coercing United States and United States-headquartered companies to censor United States persons for speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market, subverted the interest of the United States in protecting its citizens and companies, undermined the rule of law in Brazil, and jeopardized the orderly development of Brazil&#8217;s political, administrative, and economic institutions.&nbsp; The policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil are repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United&nbsp;States of America, find that the scope and gravity of the&nbsp;recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of&nbsp;Brazil constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has&nbsp;its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat. To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty rate of 40 percent on certain products of Brazil, as detailed below.&nbsp; In my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in this order.&nbsp; I am taking the action in this order only for the purpose of addressing the national emergency declared in this order and not for any other purpose. Sec . 2 . Tariff Modifications . (a) Articles of Brazil imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent. This rate of duty shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except those goods encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, and except for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. (b)&nbsp; U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the duty imposed by this order. Sec . 3 . Scope of Duties and Stacking . (a) The ad valorem duty imposed in this order is in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply. (b)&nbsp; The ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, including certain silicon metal, pig iron, civil aircraft and parts and components thereof, metallurgical grade alumina, tin ore, wood pulp, precious metals, energy and energy products, and fertilizers. (c)&nbsp; The ad valorem duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, shall apply in addition to the ad valorem duty imposed in this order, when applicable pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257. (d) &nbsp;Subject articles, except those eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duty specified in section 2 of this order and are&nbsp;admitted into a foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, must&nbsp;be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in&nbsp;19&nbsp;CFR 146.41. Sec . 4. Modification Authority. (a) To ensure that the emergency declared in this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed circumstances. (b)&nbsp; Should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States in response to this action, I will modify this order to ensure the efficacy of the actions herein ordered.&nbsp; For example, if the Government of Brazil retaliates by raising tariff rates on United States exports, I will increase the ad&nbsp;valorem duty rate set forth in this order by a corresponding amount. (c) &nbsp;Should the Government of Brazil take significant steps to address the national emergency declared in this order and align sufficiently with the United States on national security, economic, and foreign policy matters described in this order, I&nbsp;may further modify this order.

National Emergency . As President of the United States, my highest duty is protecting the national security, foreign policy, and economy of this country. Recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Members of the Government of Brazil have taken actions that interfere with the economy of the United States, infringe the free expression rights of United States persons, violate human rights, and undermine the interest the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies. Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically persecuting a former President of Brazil, which is contributing to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented actions that harm and are a threat to the economy of the United States, conflict with and threaten the policy of the United States to promote free speech and free and fair elections at home and abroad, and violate fundamental human rights. Indeed, certain Brazilian officials have issued orders to compel United States online platforms to censor the accounts or content of United States persons, where such accounts or content are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution within the United States; block the ability of United States persons to raise money on their platforms; change their content moderation policies, enforcement practices, or algorithms in ways that may result in the censorship of the content and accounts of United States persons; and provide the user data of accounts belonging to United States persons, facilitating the targeting of political critics in the United States. For example, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to target political opponents, shield corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other Brazilian officials. Justice de Moraes has authorized politically motivated police raids, arrests, and bank account freezes. He has also authorized the confiscation of passports, jailed individuals without trial for social media posts, opened unprecedented criminal investigations, including into United States citizens for their constitutionally protected speech in the United States, and issued secret orders to United States social media companies to censor thousands of posts and de-platform dozens of political critics, including United States persons, for lawful speech on United States soil. When United States and United States-headquartered companies have refused to comply with his unlawful censorship demands, Justice de Moraes has imposed substantial fines on United States and United States-headquartered companies, ordered the suspension of United States and United States-headquartered companies in Brazil, and threatened United States and United States-headquartered company executives with criminal prosecution. In fact, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing the Government of Brazil’s criminal prosecution of a United States resident for speech he made on United States soil. These judicial actions, taken under the pretext of combatting “disinformation,” “fake news,” or “anti-democratic” or “hateful” content, endanger the economy of the United States by tyrannically and arbitrarily coercing United States companies to censor political speech, turn over sensitive United States user data, or change their content moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. These actions also chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad. Brazilian officials are also persecuting former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. The Government of Brazil has unjustly charged Bolsonaro with multiple crimes related to Bolsonaro’s 2022 runoff election, and the Supreme Court of Brazil has misguidedly ruled that Bolsonaro must stand trial for these unjustified criminal charges. Political persecution, through drummed up prosecutions, threatens the orderly development of Brazil’s political, administrative, and economic institutions, including undermining the ability of Brazil to hold a free and fair election of the presidency in 2026. The Government of Brazil’s treatment of former President Bolsonaro also contributes to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. I find that the unprecedented actions taken by the Government of Brazil have violated the free expression rights of United States persons, interfered with the economy of the United States by coercing United States and United States-headquartered companies to censor United States persons for speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market, subverted the interest of the United States in protecting its citizens and companies, undermined the rule of law in Brazil, and jeopardized the orderly development of Brazil’s political, administrative, and economic institutions. The policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil are repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the scope and gravity of the recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat. To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty rate of 40 percent on certain products of Brazil, as detailed below. In my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in this order. I am taking the action in this order only for the purpose of addressing the national emergency declared in this order and not for any other purpose. Sec . 2 . Tariff Modifications . (a) Articles of Brazil imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent. This rate of duty shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except those goods encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, and except for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. (b) U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the duty imposed by this order. Sec . 3 . Scope of Duties and Stacking . (a) The ad valorem duty imposed in this order is in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply. (b) The ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, including certain silicon metal, pig iron, civil aircraft and parts and components thereof, metallurgical grade alumina, tin ore, wood pulp, precious metals, energy and energy products, and fertilizers. (c) The ad valorem duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, shall apply in addition to the ad valorem duty imposed in this order, when applicable pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257. (d) Subject articles, except those eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duty specified in section 2 of this order and are admitted into a foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, must be admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41. Sec . 4. Modification Authority. (a) To ensure that the emergency declared in this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed circumstances. (b) Should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States in response to this action, I will modify this order to ensure the efficacy of the actions herein ordered. For example, if the Government of Brazil retaliates by raising tariff rates on United States exports, I will increase the ad valorem duty rate set forth in this order by a corresponding amount. (c) Should the Government of Brazil take significant steps to address the national emergency declared in this order and align sufficiently with the United States on national security, economic, and foreign policy matters described in this order, I may further modify this order. Sec. 5. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Secretary of State shall monitor, and regularly consult with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate on, the situation involving the Government of Brazil. (b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing shall recommend to me additional action, if necessary, if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in this order or should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in this order or any subsequent order issued to address this emergency. Sec. 6. Delegation. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, is hereby authorized to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of State may, consistent with law, redelegate the authority set forth in this order within the Department of State. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to carry out this order. Sec. 7. Reporting Directives. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, is hereby authorized and directed to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in, and authorities exercised by, this order, consistent with section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 8. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of State. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 30, 2025.

Background . In Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I declared a national emergency arising from certain conditions, including the public health crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs. In that order, I found that those conditions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193, I imposed an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent on certain articles that are products of Canada and an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent on certain energy or energy resources that are products of Canada. In Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I provided that the additional ad valorem rates of duties under Executive Order 14193 do not apply to articles that are products of Canada that qualify for duty-free entry under the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA), and I reduced the additional ad valorem rate of duty on potash from 25 percent to 10 percent. Section 2(d) of Executive Order 14193 provides that &#8220;[s]hould Canada retaliate against the United States . . . through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures,&#8221; I &#8220;may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed . . . to ensure the efficacy of th[e] action&#8221; taken in Executive Order 14193. Section 3(b) of Executive Order 14193 provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with other senior officials, &#8220;shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions.&#8221; I have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials regarding, among other things, Canada&#8217;s lack of cooperation in stemming the flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs across our northern border &#8212; including its failure to devote satisfactory resources to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs &#8212; and Canada&#8217;s efforts to retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14193, as amended. After considering the additional information and recommendations that I have received, among other things, I have determined that, for the products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent, the additional ad valorem rate of duty shall increase from 25 percent to 35 percent. In my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. Sec . 2 . Implementation . (a) All articles that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent under Executive Order 14193, as amended, shall instead be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 35 percent. Accordingly, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in the Annex to this order. (b) The changes set forth herein shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025. (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect section 2(b) of Executive Order 14193 or section 2(a) or section 2(b) of Executive Order 14231. (d) The stacking rules set out in Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), and any subsequent order or proclamation addressing stacking of tariffs imposed under IEEPA, shall continue to apply to goods that are subject to subsection (a) of this section. (e) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . Sec . 3 . Transshipment . (a) all articles of Canada that do not qualify as originating under USMCA and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of origin; (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592; and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin. CBP shall not allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties. (b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due diligence. Sec . 4 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall continue to monitor, and regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, on the situation at our northern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in her opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in her opinion, might indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis or should the Government of Canada retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in Executive Order 14193 or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. Sec . 5 . Delegation . The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec . 6 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Homeland Security. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 31, 2025.

(c) Note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified by inserting new subdivision (m) in alphabetical order: “(m) For the purposes of heading 9903.01.16, products of Canada that do not qualify as originating under the United States-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties provided for by headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13, or 9903.01.15 shall be subject to an additional 40% ad valorem rate of duty in lieu of the additional rate of duty provided for in headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13, or 9903.01.15. Heading 9903.01.16 does not apply to products described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, and 9903.01.14, or products for personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons arriving in the United States. Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall also be subject to the general rates of duty imposed on products of Canada entered under subheadings in chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 apply to products of Canada including both goods of Canada under the rules set forth in part 102, title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, as well as goods for which Canada was the last country of substantial transformation prior to importation into the United States. Products of Canada that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or reductions under subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall not apply to goods for which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter 98 of the tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of CBP, and whenever CBP agrees that entry under such a provision is appropriate, except for goods entered under heading 9802.00.80; and subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60. For subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, the additional duties apply to the value of repairs, alterations, or processing performed (in Canada), as described in the applicable subheading. For heading 9802.00.80, the additional duties apply to the value of the article assembled abroad (in Canada), less the cost or value of such products of the United States, as described. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 shall continue to be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties, taxes, fees, exactions and charges that apply to such products. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 that are otherwise eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) — known as the “de minimis” exemption – may continue to qualify for the exemption, but the de minimis exemption shall cease to be available for such articles upon notification by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to the President that adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue applicable for covered articles otherwise eligible for the de minimis exemption. (d) The HTSUS is modified as follows, to implement this provision: (i) by inserting the following new heading 9903.01.16 in numerical sequence, with the material in the new heading inserted in the columns of the HTSUS labeled “Heading/Subheading”, “Article Description”, “Rates of Duty 1—General”, “Rates of Duty 1—Special” and “Rates of Duty 2”, respectively: Heading/ &nbsp; Subheading &nbsp; Article Description &nbsp; Rates of Duty &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; General &nbsp; Special &nbsp; “9903.01.16&nbsp; &nbsp; Except for products described in 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, and 9903.01.14, articles the product of Canada as provided for in subdivision (m) to note 2 to this subchapter and determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties. &nbsp;The duty provided in the applicable subheading + 40%&nbsp; The duty provided in the applicable subheading&nbsp; The duty provided in the applicable subheading”&nbsp; News Wire Issues Contact Visit EOP Administration Gallery Video Library America 250 Founding Fathers The Signers Subscribe to The White House newsletter Please leave blank.

Background . In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States. I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate. I have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials on, among other things, the&nbsp;continued lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships and the impact of foreign trading partners&#8217; disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports, the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base.&nbsp; I also have received additional information and recommendations on foreign relations, economic, and national security matters, including the status of trade negotiations, efforts to retaliate against the United States for its actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and efforts to align with the United States on economic and national security matters. For example, some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.&nbsp; Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.&nbsp; There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or&nbsp;to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United&nbsp;States on economic and national security matters. After considering the information and recommendations that I have recently received, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257, as amended, in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on goods of such trading partners in Executive Order 14257, as amended. Sec . 2 . Tariff Modifications . (a) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. These modifications shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed in Executive Order 14257, as amended. (b)&nbsp; Certain foreign trading partners identified in Annex I to this order have agreed to, or are on the verge of concluding, meaningful trade and security agreements with the United States.&nbsp; Goods of those trading partners will remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties provided in Annex I to this order until such time as those agreements are concluded, and I issue subsequent orders memorializing the terms of those agreements. (c)&nbsp; As provided in Annex I to this order, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to any good of the European Union is determined by the good&#8217;s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 (General) of the HTSUS (&#8220;Column 1 Duty Rate&#8221;).&nbsp; For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent.&nbsp; For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15&nbsp;percent, the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero. (d) &nbsp;Goods of any foreign trading partner that is not listed in Annex I to this order will be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, unless otherwise expressly provided.&nbsp; This rate shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order. (e)&nbsp; The HTSUS shall also be modified by continuing to suspend headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)–(9) and (11)‑(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until the effective date of the modifications provided in&nbsp;Annex II to this order.&nbsp; Upon the effective date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order, to facilitate implementation of the rates of duty provided in Annex I to this order, headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, which are organized by rate of duty, and subdivisions (v)(xiii) (1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be terminated as&nbsp;to future entries and replaced by the new trading partner-specific headings provided in Annex II to this order. (f)&nbsp; Excluding the changes set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply. (g)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People&#8217;s Republic of China). (h)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register . Sec . 3 . Transshipment . (a) An article determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of origin, (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592, and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin. CBP shall not allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due diligence. Sec . 4 . Implementation . The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the International Trade Commission, are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall monitor the circumstances involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and shall regularly consult on such circumstances with any senior official they deem appropriate. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall also inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate that a foreign trading partner has taken adequate steps to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with any senior official they deem appropriate, shall recommend to me any necessary additional action if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should a foreign trading partner fail to take adequate steps to&nbsp;address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or&nbsp;should a foreign trading partner retaliate against the United&nbsp;States in response to the actions taken to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or any subsequent order issued to address that emergency. Sec . 6 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Sec . 2 . Amendment . Executive Order 13265 of June 6, 2002 (President&#8217;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports), is hereby amended as follows: (a) The title is revised to read as follows: &#8220;President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and the Reestablishment of the Presidential Fitness Test&#8221;. (b) The preamble is revised to read as follows: &#8220;By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to establish the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and to reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, it is hereby ordered:&#8221;. (c) Sections 1 through 5 are revised to read as follows: &#8220; Section 1 . Purpose . As the United States prepares to celebrate its semiquincentennial anniversary in 2026, we must address the threat to the vitality and longevity of our country that is posed by America&#8217;s declining health and physical fitness. For far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has been neglected. Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children. These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance, and national morale. President Eisenhower recognized this issue when he created the President&#8217;s Council on Youth Fitness in response to reports on the poor state of youth fitness in America. As President-elect, John F. Kennedy famously published an essay titled &#8220;The Soft American,&#8221; which outlined the imperative for improved health in order to maintain a strong and vital America. During my first term, I renamed the council the &#8220;President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition&#8221; and directed the development of a National Youth Sports Strategy, among other activities. My Administration has taken decisive action to reverse this health crisis. In the first month of my second term, I created the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission to restore the urgency of improving the health of Americans. Now, we build further. To advance this commitment, I hereby reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, which shall be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the support of the Secretary of Education. With this order, I revitalize the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition as a cornerstone of our national health renewal. In 2026, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great Nation, honor the 70th anniversary of the original President&#8217;s Council on Youth Fitness, and showcase America&#8217;s continued global dominance in sports. Over the next 3 years, America will host the Ryder Cup, the President&#8217;s Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games &#8212; the world&#8217;s premiere sporting competitions. These events will provide inspiration for all generations of Americans. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of my Administration to: (a) prioritize and expand children&#8217;s participation in youth sports and active play; (b) promote the physical, mental, and civic benefits of daily movement, exercise, and good nutrition; and (c) engage every sector &#8212; public and private, civilian and military &#8212; in creating a national culture of strength, vitality, and excellence. Sec . 3 . President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition (Council). (b) The Council shall consist of up to 30 members appointed by the President. Members shall serve for a term of 2 years, shall be eligible for reappointment, and may continue to serve after the expiration of their terms until the appointment of a successor. The President may designate one or more of the members as Chair or Vice Chair. (c) The President shall designate an Executive Director of the Council who shall manage day-to-day operations; serve as a liaison to the President on matters and activities pertaining to the Council; and oversee engagement with executive departments and agencies, athletic institutions, and community partners. Sec . 4 . Functions of the Council . (a) The Council shall advise the President concerning progress made in carrying out the provisions of this order and shall recommend to the President actions to accelerate such progress. (b) In advising the President pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Council shall recommend: (i) strategies for reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test, with any appropriate improvements, as the main assessment tool for a Presidential Fitness Award; (ii) strategies for the development and promotion of Presidential challenges and school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education; (iii) actions to expand opportunities at the global, national, State, and local levels for participation in sports and engagement in physical fitness; (iv) bold and innovative fitness goals for American youth with the aim of fostering a new generation of healthy, active citizens; (v) campaigns and events that elevate American sports, military readiness, and health traditions; (vi) opportunities at the global, national, State, and local levels that expand participation in sports and emphasize the importance of an active lifestyle and good nutrition, which should include partnerships with professional athletes, sports organizations, player&#8217;s associations, influential figures, nonprofit organizations, and community groups to inspire all Americans, among other initiatives; and (vii) strategies to address the growing national security threat posed by the increasing rates of childhood obesity, chronic diseases, and sedentary lifestyles, which threaten the future readiness of the United States workforce and military. Sec . 5 . Administration . (a) Each executive department and agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of funds, furnish such information and assistance to the Council as it may request. (b) Members of the Council shall serve without compensation but may receive travel reimbursement, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as allowed under applicable law (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds. (c) The Department of Health and Human Services shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Council may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.

(f) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ) (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), may apply to the administration of any portion of this order, any functions of the President under the Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in accordance with the guidelines and procedures issued by the Administrator of General Services. (g) In accordance with the Act, the Council shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order, unless extended by the President. (h) Executive Order 12345 of February 2, 1982 (Physical Fitness and Sports), as amended, is revoked.&#8221;. (d) A new section 6 is added to read as follows: &#8220; Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.&#8221;. Sec . 3 . General Provisions .

Background . Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022 (Prohibiting Certain Imports and New Investments With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts To Undermine the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine), expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation), to include the actions taken against Ukraine by the Government of the Russian Federation. To address that unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, Executive Order 14066 prohibited, among other things, the importation into the United States of certain products of Russian Federation origin, including crude oil; petroleum; and petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation. I have received additional information from various senior officials on, among other things, the actions of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to the situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; After considering this additional information, among other things, I find that the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 continues and that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. To deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India, which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.&nbsp; In my judgment, imposing tariffs, as described below, in addition to maintaining the other measures taken to address the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, will more effectively deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066.&nbsp; Sec . 2 . Imposition of Tariffs . (a) I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. (b)&nbsp; Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional&nbsp; ad valorem&nbsp; rate of duty of 25 percent.&nbsp; Subject to section 3 of this order, this rate of duty shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order, except for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 17, 2025. Sec. 3.&nbsp; Scope of Duties and Stacking. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall be in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the&nbsp; ad valorem&nbsp; duty imposed in this order shall not apply. (b)&nbsp; The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall not apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b). (c) The ad valorem duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall not apply to articles that are set forth in Annex II to Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended. (d)&nbsp; The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended, shall apply in addition to the&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order, when applicable pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257. (e) Except for those articles that are eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, articles that are subject to the duty imposed in section 2 of this order and are admitted into a foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.41. Sec . 4 . Modification Authority . (a) To ensure that the emergency described in section 1 of this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed circumstances. (b)&nbsp; Should a foreign country retaliate against the United States in response to this action, I may modify this order to ensure the efficacy of the actions herein ordered.&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Should the Government of the Russian Federation or a foreign country impacted by this order take significant steps to address the national emergency described in section 1 of this order and align sufficiently with the United States on national security, foreign policy, and economic matters, I may further modify this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any other senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, shall determine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. If the Secretary of Commerce finds that a country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend whether and to what extent I should take action as to that country, including whether I should impose an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent on imports of articles of that country. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of State shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate on the emergency described in section 1 of this order. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend to me additional action, if necessary, if the actions in this order are not effective in resolving the emergency described in section 1 of this order or should the Government of the Russian Federation or another foreign country retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in this order or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency described in section 1 of this order. Sec . 6 . Delegation . (a) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of State may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of State. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to carry out this order. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . (c) U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer a duty imposed by this order or any action taken pursuant to this order. Sec . 7 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &nbsp;The term &#8220;Russian Federation oil&#8221; means crude oil or petroleum products extracted, refined, or exported from the Russian Federation, regardless of the nationality of the entity involved in the production or sale of such crude oil or petroleum products. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;indirectly importing&#8221; includes purchasing Russian Federation oil through intermediaries or third countries where the origin of the oil can reasonably be traced to Russia, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury. Sec . 8 . Severability . If any provision of this order or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. Sec . 9 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Background . As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation&#8217;s capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime. The local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation&#8217;s capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city. Sec . 2 . Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard . Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation&#8217;s capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia . Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation&#8217;s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government&#8217;s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government&#8217;s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation&#8217;s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence. The increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. &nbsp;Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. &nbsp;Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. &nbsp;These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government.&nbsp; Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. &nbsp;The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work. The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. &nbsp;In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. &nbsp;Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. &nbsp;It also experienced the Nation&#8217;s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents &#8212; over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. &nbsp;The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world. As President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation&#8217;s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. &nbsp;These conditions cannot persist. &nbsp;We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous. Sec . 2 . Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia . I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation&#8217;s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act. Sec . 3 . Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia . (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General. (b) &nbsp;In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate. Sec . 4 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes. (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes. (c)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General&#8217;s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary. Sec . 5 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy . America has long led the world in innovation, technological advancement, and design. But with a sprawling ecosystem of digital services offered to Americans, the Government has lagged behind in usability and aesthetics. There is a high financial cost to maintaining legacy systems, to say nothing of the cost in time lost by the American public trying to navigate them. It is time to fill the digital potholes across our Nation. With this order, I am announcing &#8220;America by Design,&#8221; a national initiative to improve experiences for Americans, starting by breathing new life into the design of sites where people interface with their Government.&nbsp; It is time to update the Government&#8217;s design language to be both usable and beautiful. &nbsp;This effort will be facilitated by a new National Design Studio and by a new Chief Design Officer.&nbsp; The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions. It is the policy of my Administration to deliver digital and physical experiences that are both beautiful and efficient, improving the quality of life for our Nation.&nbsp; Towards that end, the National Design Studio will advise agencies on how to reduce duplicative design costs, use standardized design to enhance the public&#8217;s trust in high-impact service providers, and dramatically improve the quality of experiences offered to the American public. Sec . 2 . Establishing America by Design and the National Design Studio . (a) There is established a national initiative, America by Design, to improve comprehensively the visual presentation and usability of Federal services provided to the public in both digital and physical spaces, creating first-class online and offline experiences for Americans. (b) &nbsp;To help facilitate the America by Design initiative, there is established within the White House Office of the Executive Office of the President the National Design Studio (NDS) and, within the NDS, a new position entitled the Chief Design Officer.&nbsp; The NDS shall be led by an Administrator, who shall report to the Office of the White House Chief of Staff.&nbsp; There is further established within the NDS, in accordance with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, a&nbsp;temporary organization headed by the NDS Administrator and dedicated to helping advance the America by Design initiative.&nbsp; The temporary organization shall terminate 3 years from the date of this order, but that termination shall not be interpreted to imply the termination, attenuation, or amendment of any other authority or provision of this order. Sec . 3 . Implementing America by Design . (a) Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to implement the America by Design initiative at their respective agencies and shall produce initial results by July 4, 2026. (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heads of agencies shall prioritize improving websites and physical sites that have a major impact on Americans&#8217; everyday lives.&nbsp; (ii) The Administrator of General Services shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to update the United States Web Design System consistent with the policies set forth in this order. (iii) &nbsp;Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to ensure Government-wide compliance with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, Public Law 115-336. (b) The Chief Design Officer shall consult with thought leaders and research and design firms on how best to implement the America by Design initiative. In order to employ the most talented designers of our generation to serve their country, the Chief Design Officer shall help recruit designers and other experts from the private sector as well as other sources of expertise. Heads of agencies shall use all relevant hiring authorities to facilitate this effort, including title IV of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, Public Law 91-648, 5 U.S.C. 3371 et seq. (c)&nbsp; The Chief Design Officer shall consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as appropriate, in carrying out his or her obligations under this order. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . America has long led the world in innovation, technological advancement, and design. But with a sprawling ecosystem of digital services offered to Americans, the Government has lagged behind in usability and aesthetics. There is a high financial cost to maintaining legacy systems, to say nothing of the cost in time lost by the American public trying to navigate them. It is time to fill the digital potholes across our Nation. With this order, I am announcing “America by Design,” a national initiative to improve experiences for Americans, starting by breathing new life into the design of sites where people interface with their Government. It is time to update the Government’s design language to be both usable and beautiful. This effort will be facilitated by a new National Design Studio and by a new Chief Design Officer. The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions. It is the policy of my Administration to deliver digital and physical experiences that are both beautiful and efficient, improving the quality of life for our Nation. Towards that end, the National Design Studio will advise agencies on how to reduce duplicative design costs, use standardized design to enhance the public’s trust in high-impact service providers, and dramatically improve the quality of experiences offered to the American public. Sec . 2 . Establishing America by Design and the National Design Studio . (a) There is established a national initiative, America by Design, to improve comprehensively the visual presentation and usability of Federal services provided to the public in both digital and physical spaces, creating first-class online and offline experiences for Americans. (b) To help facilitate the America by Design initiative, there is established within the White House Office of the Executive Office of the President the National Design Studio (NDS) and, within the NDS, a new position entitled the Chief Design Officer. The NDS shall be led by an Administrator, who shall report to the Office of the White House Chief of Staff. There is further established within the NDS, in accordance with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, a temporary organization headed by the NDS Administrator and dedicated to helping advance the America by Design initiative. The temporary organization shall terminate 3 years from the date of this order, but that termination shall not be interpreted to imply the termination, attenuation, or amendment of any other authority or provision of this order. Sec . 3 . Implementing America by Design . (a) Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to implement the America by Design initiative at their respective agencies and shall produce initial results by July 4, 2026. (i) Heads of agencies shall prioritize improving websites and physical sites that have a major impact on Americans’ everyday lives. (ii) The Administrator of General Services shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to update the United States Web Design System consistent with the policies set forth in this order. (iii) Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to ensure Government-wide compliance with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, Public Law 115-336. (b) The Chief Design Officer shall consult with thought leaders and research and design firms on how best to implement the America by Design initiative. In order to employ the most talented designers of our generation to serve their country, the Chief Design Officer shall help recruit designers and other experts from the private sector as well as other sources of expertise. Heads of agencies shall use all relevant hiring authorities to facilitate this effort, including title IV of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, Public Law 91-648, 5 U.S.C. 3371 et seq. (c) The Chief Design Officer shall consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as appropriate, in carrying out his or her obligations under this order. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

On July 2, 2021, as an empowered Taliban was in the midst of waging a civil war in Afghanistan, President Joe Biden began a disastrous withdrawal from Bagram Airfield in the middle of the night without alerting Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.&nbsp; As a direct result of the Biden Administration&#8217;s reckless political stunt designed to claim victory on the 20th anniversary of September 11, 2001, our men and women in uniform were left without a defensible base of operations, allowing the Taliban to free thousands of bloodthirsty terrorists and criminals held captive at Bagram prison. At exactly 5:36pm on August 26, 2021, a barbaric ISIS-K terrorist &#8212; one of the prisoners set free by the Taliban less than two months earlier &#8212; detonated a suicide bomb at a civilian gate of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the main entry point for an evacuation operation.&nbsp; As a result, 13 brave American service members were killed, 45 were wounded, and more than 160 civilians were injured, resulting in the single deadliest day for United States forces in a decade. In what will be remembered as one of the most shameful and heartbreaking moments in our Nation&#8217;s collective memory, Joe Biden checked his watch &#8212; and time stood still &#8212; as a Sailor, Soldier, and 11 Marines returned home in flag-draped coffins, solemnly escorted by their brothers and sisters in arms.&nbsp; We will never forget the names of the 13 brave souls who shed their blood for our Nation: &nbsp;Staff Sergeant Darin T. Hoover, USMC; Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo, USMC; Sergeant Nicole L. Gee, USMC; Corporal Hunter Lopez, USMC; Corporal Daegan W. Page, USMC; Corporal Humberto A.

Nikoui, USMC; Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak, USN; and Staff Sergeant Ryan C. Knauss, USA. As Commander in Chief, I will never allow our military service members to be so betrayed, our friends to be so abandoned, and our credibility to be so destroyed. To those who lost a son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife, or family member at Abbey Gate in 2021 &#8212; we offer you our enduring love and our unwavering devotion.&nbsp; To those who horrifically suffered life-altering wounds &#8212; we extend our unending support and eternal gratitude for your unsung sacrifices.&nbsp; To those who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and beyond &#8212; you should be tremendously proud of your service to our Nation and your devotion to preserving our freedoms. The events of that day led to an unimaginable loss of human life and the single most embarrassing display of American foreign policy in the history of our country.&nbsp; In the wake of the attack, countless Americans and our Afghan allies were abandoned behind Taliban lines, 10 innocent civilians &#8212; including children &#8212; were killed in a feckless counterstrike ordered by President Biden, $85 billion worth of United States military equipment was surrendered to the enemy, and 20 years of American blood and treasure were utterly squandered.&nbsp; The weakness and incompetence that led to Abbey Gate lived on in the&nbsp;American memory as the moment our credibility was all but lost &#8212; until the clock struck noon on January 20, 2025. On day one, my Administration sought to bring justice to the families of the Abbey Gate 13 by aggressively pursuing a foreign policy rooted in the commonsense principle of peace through strength.&nbsp; Just 43 days into my second term, on the night of March 4, 2025, during my Joint Address to the Congress, I announced that we apprehended the ISIS Jihadi responsible for the atrocity at the Kabul airport &#8212; who was at that moment being brought to the United States to face the swift sword of American justice.&nbsp; When America is strong, the world is safe, fewer conflicts erupt on the field of battle, and the lives of our men and women in uniform are cherished and protected.

The Attorney General shall update this list as necessary. (b) &nbsp;The head of each executive department and agency, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify Federal funds, including grants and contracts, currently provided to cashless bail jurisdictions identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section that may be suspended or terminated, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.

Purpose and Policy . As stated in Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), there is a crime emergency in Washington, D.C., that is impeding the operations and responsibilities of the Federal Government. The District of Columbia government&#8217;s pretrial release policies, which include prohibiting cash bail, contribute to the disgraceful conditions referenced in the aforementioned Executive Order, as law enforcement must arrest the same individuals multiple times, and dangerous criminals are sometimes rapidly released. This leaves such criminals free to endanger American citizens visiting our Nation&#8217;s capital, Federal workers discharging their duties to our Nation, and citizens of the District of Columbia trying to live their lives safely. It is therefore the policy of my Administration that all necessary and lawful measures be taken to end cashless bail policies and ensure the pretrial detention of any criminal suspect who threatens public safety. Sec . 2 . Ending Unwarranted Pretrial Release in the District of Columbia . (a) To prevent the release of dangerous suspects based on cashless bail policies, relevant Federal law enforcement agencies and officials who are members of the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force established in Executive Order 14252 of March 27, 2025 (Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful), shall work to ensure that arrestees in the District of Columbia are held in Federal custody to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and shall pursue Federal charges and pretrial detention for such arrestees whenever possible, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that criminal defendants who pose a threat to public safety are not released from custody prior to trial. (b)&nbsp; Further, the Attorney General shall review the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) General Orders and other policies and practices of the MPD to identify those that may result in pretrial release of criminal defendants who pose a threat to public safety and, consistent with section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), shall request that the Mayor of the District of Columbia make such updates and modifications to such orders and policies as the Attorney General determines would be necessary to address the crime emergency and help to ensure public order and safety. Sec . 3 . Measures to End Cashless Bail in the District of Columbia . (a) The Attorney General shall determine whether the District of Columbia continues to maintain a policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from jail for crimes prosecuted under the Code of the District of Columbia in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia where the arrestee poses a clear threat to public safety and order. Such cases include violent or sexual offenses such as rape, murder, carjacking, and assault, as well as property offenses such as burglary, looting, and vandalism. The Attorney General shall update her determination if the District of Columbia changes its cashless bail policies or practices. (b) If the Attorney General determines that the District of Columbia continues to maintain a policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail, the head of each executive department or agency (agency), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify appropriate actions to press the District of Columbia to change its policies with respect to cashless bail. Such actions may include Federal funding decisions or the provision of Federal services or approvals by agency heads, as well as actions the Attorney General identifies as necessary and appropriate because of the emergency conditions based upon which section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act has been invoked. The head of each agency shall undertake any such actions he or she deems appropriate, consistent with applicable law. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . Our great American Flag is the most sacred and cherished symbol of the United States of America, and of American freedom, identity, and strength. Over nearly two-and-a-half centuries, many thousands of American patriots have fought, bled, and died to keep the Stars and Stripes waving proudly. The American Flag is a special symbol in our national life that should unite and represent all Americans of every background and walk of life. Desecrating it is uniquely offensive and provocative. It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our Nation &#8212; the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security. Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot. American Flag burning is also used by groups of foreign nationals as a calculated act to intimidate and threaten violence against Americans because of their nationality and place of birth. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings on First Amendment protections, the Court has never held that American Flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to &#8220;fighting words&#8221; is constitutionally protected.&nbsp; See Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397, 408-10 (1989). My Administration will act to restore respect and sanctity to the American Flag and prosecute those who incite violence or otherwise violate our laws while desecrating this symbol of our country, to the fullest extent permissible under any available authority. Sec . 2 . Measures to Combat Desecration of the American Flag . (a) The Attorney General shall prioritize the enforcement to the fullest extent possible of our Nation&#8217;s criminal and civil laws against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment. This may include, but is not limited to, violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans&#8217; civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace, as well as conspiracies and attempts to violate, and aiding and abetting others to violate, such laws. (b)&nbsp; In cases where the Department of Justice or another executive department or agency (agency) determines that an instance of American Flag desecration may violate an applicable State or local law, such as open burning restrictions, disorderly conduct laws, or destruction of property laws, the agency shall refer the matter to the appropriate State or local authority for potential action. (c)&nbsp; To the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, the Attorney General shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area. (d) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting within their respective authorities, shall deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal from the United States, pursuant to Federal law, including 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), 8 U.S.C. 1424, 8 U.S.C. 1427, 8 U.S.C. 1451(c), and 8 U.S.C. 1227(a), whenever there has been an appropriate determination that foreign nationals have engaged in American Flag-desecration activity under circumstances that permit the exercise of such remedies pursuant to Federal law. Sec . 3 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Crime Emergency . Two weeks ago, I declared a crime emergency in the District of Columbia to address the rampant violence and disorder that have undermined the proper and safe functioning of the Federal Government, and therefore, the Nation, and that have led to disgraceful conditions in our Nation&#8217;s capital. In furtherance of Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), I am now ordering further actions to address the conditions described in that Executive Order. Sec . 2 . Operational Actions . (a) The Director of the National Park Service shall, subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, hire additional members of the United States Park Police in the District of Columbia to support the policy goals described in Executive Order 14333. The United States Park Police shall ensure enforcement of all applicable laws within their jurisdiction, including the Code of the District of Columbia, to help maintain public safety and proper order. (b) &nbsp;The United States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall, subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, hire additional prosecutors to focus on prosecuting violent and property crimes. (c) &nbsp;The D.C.

Purpose . The Founders, in line with great societies before them, attached great importance to Federal civic architecture. They wanted America&#8217;s public buildings to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, D.C., on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions. Washington and Jefferson personally oversaw the competitions to design the Capitol Building and the White House. Under the direction and following the vision of these two Founders, Pierre Charles L&#8217;Enfant designed the Nation&#8217;s capital as a classical city. For approximately a century and a half following America&#8217;s founding, America&#8217;s Federal architecture continued to be characterized by beautiful and beloved buildings of largely, though not exclusively, classical design. In the 1960s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist and brutalist ones. The Federal architecture that ensued, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA), was often unpopular with Americans. The new buildings ranged from the undistinguished to designs even GSA now admits many in the public found unappealing. In 1994, GSA responded to this widespread criticism by establishing the Design Excellence Program. The GSA intended that program to &#8220;provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.&#8221; Unfortunately, the program has not met this goal. Under the Design Excellence Program, GSA has often selected designs by prominent architects with little regard for local input or regional aesthetic preferences. The resulting Federal architecture sometimes impresses the architectural elite, but not the American people who the buildings are meant to serve. Many of these new Federal buildings are not even visibly identifiable as civic buildings. It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) Applicable Federal public buildings should uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, and command respect from the general public. They should also be visually identifiable as civic buildings and, as appropriate, respect regional architectural heritage. Architecture &#8212; particularly traditional and classical architecture &#8212; that meets the criteria set forth in this subsection is the preferred architecture for applicable Federal public buildings. In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture. (b) Where the architecture of applicable Federal public buildings diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection (a) of this section, great care and consideration must be taken to choose a design that commands respect from the general public and clearly conveys to the general public the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of America&#8217;s system of self-government. (c) When renovating, reducing, or expanding applicable Federal public buildings that do not meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the feasibility and potential expense of building redesign to meet those criteria should be examined. Where feasible and economical, such redesign should be given substantial consideration, especially with regard to the building&#8217;s exterior. Sec . 3 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &#8220;Applicable Federal public building&#8221; means: (i) all Federal courthouses and agency headquarters; (ii) all Federal public buildings in the National Capital Region; and (iii) all other Federal public buildings that cost or are expected to cost more than $50 million in 2025 dollars to design, build, and finish, but does not include infrastructure projects or land ports of entry. (b) &#8220;Brutalist architecture&#8221; means the style of architecture that grew out of the early 20th-century modernist movement that is characterized by a massive and block-like appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of exposed poured concrete. (c) &#8220;Classical architecture&#8221; means the architectural tradition derived from the forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity, and as later developed and expanded upon by such Renaissance architects as Alberti, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Palladio; such Enlightenment masters as Robert Adam, John Soane, and Christopher Wren; such 19th-century architects as Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Robert Mills, and Thomas U. Walter; and such 20th-century practitioners as Julian Abele, Daniel Burnham, Rafael Carmoega, Charles F. McKim, John Russell Pope, Julia Morgan, and the firm of Delano and Aldrich. Classical architecture encompasses such styles as Neoclassical, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Beaux-Arts, and Art Deco. (d) &#8220;Deconstructivist architecture&#8221; means the style of architecture generally known as &#8220;deconstructivism&#8221; that emerged during the late 1980s and that features fragmentation, disorder, discontinuity, distortion, skewed geometry, and the appearance of instability. (e) &#8220;General public&#8221; means members of the public who are not: (i) artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or architecture, or members of the building industry; or (ii) affiliated with any interest group, trade association, or any other organization, whose membership is financially affected by decisions involving the design, construction, or remodeling of public buildings. (f) &#8220;Public building&#8221; has the meaning given that term in section 3301(a)(5) of title 40, United States Code. (g) &#8220;Traditional architecture&#8221; includes classical architecture, as defined herein, and also includes the historic humanistic architecture such as Gothic, Romanesque, Second Empire, Pueblo Revival, Spanish Colonial, and other Mediterranean styles of architecture historically rooted in various regions of America. (h) &#8220;2025 dollars&#8221; means dollars adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product price deflator and using 2025 as the base year. Sec . 4 . Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture . (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall to the extent practicable adhere to the following Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture: (i) The policy shall be to provide requisite and adequate facilities in an architectural style and form that is distinguished and that will reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government. Because of their proven ability to meet these requirements, classical and traditional architecture are preferred modes of architectural design. This preference does not exclude the possibility of alternative styles in appropriate circumstances. Major emphasis should be placed on the choice of designs that embody architectural excellence. Specific attention should be paid to the possibilities of incorporating into such designs qualities that reflect the regional architectural traditions of that part of the Nation in which buildings are located. Where appropriate, fine art should be incorporated in the designs, with emphasis on the work of living American artists. Designs shall adhere to sound construction practice and utilize materials, methods, and equipment of proven dependability. Buildings shall be economical to build, operate, and maintain, and should be accessible to the handicapped. (ii) Design must flow from the needs of the Government and the aspirations and preferences of the American people to the architectural profession, and not vice versa. Competitions for the design of Federal buildings should be held where appropriate. The advice of distinguished architects practiced in classical or traditional architecture should, as a rule, be sought prior to the award of important design contracts. (iii) The choice and development of the building site should be considered the first step of the design process. This choice should be made in cooperation with local agencies. Special attention should be paid to the general ensemble of streets and public places of which Federal buildings will form a part. Where possible, buildings should be located so as to permit a generous development of landscape. Sec . 5 . GSA Actions . (a) The Administrator of General Services (Administrator) shall adhere to the policies and principles set forth in sections 2 and 4 of this order, and shall expeditiously update GSA policies and procedures to incorporate such policies and principles and advance the purposes of this order. (b) The Administrator shall: (i) ensure that GSA architects whose duties include reviewing, assisting with, or approving the selection of architects or designs for applicable Federal public buildings have formal training in, or substantial and significant experience with, classical or traditional architecture; (ii) create the position of senior advisor for architectural design, for an individual with specialized experience in classical architecture, to help develop GSA procedures, advise on architectural standards, and provide guidance during design evaluations or design juries; (iii) where the design of an applicable Federal public building is selected pursuant to a design-build competition under section 3309 of title 41, United States Code, list experience with classical or traditional architecture as specialized experience and technical competence in the phase-one solicitation, and give substantive weight to these factors when evaluating which offerors will be advanced to phase two; and (iv) consistent with sections 4302 and 4312 of title 5, United States Code, make advancing the purposes and implementing the policies of this order a critical performance element in the individual performance plans of the Chief Architect of GSA and appropriate subordinate employees in the GSA Public Buildings Service involved in selecting designs for applicable Federal public buildings (c) Where GSA intends to select a building design pursuant to a design competition, the Administrator shall actively recruit architectural firms and, as applicable, designers with experience in classical and traditional architecture to enter such competition and shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that multiple designs in such modes are advanced to the final evaluation round. (d) In the event the Administrator proposes to approve a design for a new applicable Federal public building that diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection 2(a) of this order, including Brutalist or Deconstructivist architecture or any design derived from or related to these types of architecture, the Administrator shall notify the President through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy not less than 30 days before GSA could reject such design without incurring substantial expenditures. Such notification shall set forth the reasons the Administrator proposes to approve such design, including: (i) a detailed explanation of why the Administrator believes selecting such design is justified, with particular focus on whether such design is as beautiful and reflective of the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American system of self-government as alternative designs using preferred architecture; (ii) the total expected cost of adopting the proposed design, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout its expected lifecycle; and (iii) a description of the designs using preferred architecture seriously considered for such project and the total expected cost of adopting such designs, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout their expected lifecycles. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the General Services Administration. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 28, 2025.

Purpose . The Founders, in line with great societies before them, attached great importance to Federal civic architecture. They wanted America’s public buildings to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, D.C., on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions. Washington and Jefferson personally oversaw the competitions to design the Capitol Building and the White House. Under the direction and following the vision of these two Founders, Pierre Charles L’Enfant designed the Nation’s capital as a classical city. For approximately a century and a half following America’s founding, America’s Federal architecture continued to be characterized by beautiful and beloved buildings of largely, though not exclusively, classical design. In the 1960s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist and brutalist ones. The Federal architecture that ensued, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA), was often unpopular with Americans. The new buildings ranged from the undistinguished to designs even GSA now admits many in the public found unappealing. In 1994, GSA responded to this widespread criticism by establishing the Design Excellence Program. The GSA intended that program to “provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.” Unfortunately, the program has not met this goal. Under the Design Excellence Program, GSA has often selected designs by prominent architects with little regard for local input or regional aesthetic preferences. The resulting Federal architecture sometimes impresses the architectural elite, but not the American people who the buildings are meant to serve. Many of these new Federal buildings are not even visibly identifiable as civic buildings. It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) Applicable Federal public buildings should uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, and command respect from the general public. They should also be visually identifiable as civic buildings and, as appropriate, respect regional architectural heritage. Architecture — particularly traditional and classical architecture — that meets the criteria set forth in this subsection is the preferred architecture for applicable Federal public buildings. In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture. (b) Where the architecture of applicable Federal public buildings diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection (a) of this section, great care and consideration must be taken to choose a design that commands respect from the general public and clearly conveys to the general public the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of America’s system of self-government. (c) When renovating, reducing, or expanding applicable Federal public buildings that do not meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the feasibility and potential expense of building redesign to meet those criteria should be examined. Where feasible and economical, such redesign should be given substantial consideration, especially with regard to the building’s exterior. Sec . 3 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) “Applicable Federal public building” means: (i) all Federal courthouses and agency headquarters; (ii) all Federal public buildings in the National Capital Region; and (iii) all other Federal public buildings that cost or are expected to cost more than $50 million in 2025 dollars to design, build, and finish, but does not include infrastructure projects or land ports of entry. (b) “Brutalist architecture” means the style of architecture that grew out of the early 20th-century modernist movement that is characterized by a massive and block-like appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of exposed poured concrete. (c) “Classical architecture” means the architectural tradition derived from the forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity, and as later developed and expanded upon by such Renaissance architects as Alberti, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Palladio; such Enlightenment masters as Robert Adam, John Soane, and Christopher Wren; such 19th-century architects as Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Robert Mills, and Thomas U. Walter; and such 20th-century practitioners as Julian Abele, Daniel Burnham, Rafael Carmoega, Charles F. McKim, John Russell Pope, Julia Morgan, and the firm of Delano and Aldrich. Classical architecture encompasses such styles as Neoclassical, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Beaux-Arts, and Art Deco. (d) “Deconstructivist architecture” means the style of architecture generally known as “deconstructivism” that emerged during the late 1980s and that features fragmentation, disorder, discontinuity, distortion, skewed geometry, and the appearance of instability. (e) “General public” means members of the public who are not: (i) artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or architecture, or members of the building industry; or (ii) affiliated with any interest group, trade association, or any other organization, whose membership is financially affected by decisions involving the design, construction, or remodeling of public buildings. (f) “Public building” has the meaning given that term in section 3301(a)(5) of title 40, United States Code. (g) “Traditional architecture” includes classical architecture, as defined herein, and also includes the historic humanistic architecture such as Gothic, Romanesque, Second Empire, Pueblo Revival, Spanish Colonial, and other Mediterranean styles of architecture historically rooted in various regions of America. (h) “2025 dollars” means dollars adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Gross Domestic Product price deflator and using 2025 as the base year. Sec . 4 . Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture . (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall to the extent practicable adhere to the following Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture: (i) The policy shall be to provide requisite and adequate facilities in an architectural style and form that is distinguished and that will reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government. Because of their proven ability to meet these requirements, classical and traditional architecture are preferred modes of architectural design. This preference does not exclude the possibility of alternative styles in appropriate circumstances. Major emphasis should be placed on the choice of designs that embody architectural excellence. Specific attention should be paid to the possibilities of incorporating into such designs qualities that reflect the regional architectural traditions of that part of the Nation in which buildings are located. Where appropriate, fine art should be incorporated in the designs, with emphasis on the work of living American artists. Designs shall adhere to sound construction practice and utilize materials, methods, and equipment of proven dependability. Buildings shall be economical to build, operate, and maintain, and should be accessible to the handicapped. (ii) Design must flow from the needs of the Government and the aspirations and preferences of the American people to the architectural profession, and not vice versa. Competitions for the design of Federal buildings should be held where appropriate. The advice of distinguished architects practiced in classical or traditional architecture should, as a rule, be sought prior to the award of important design contracts. (iii) The choice and development of the building site should be considered the first step of the design process. This choice should be made in cooperation with local agencies. Special attention should be paid to the general ensemble of streets and public places of which Federal buildings will form a part. Where possible, buildings should be located so as to permit a generous development of landscape. Sec . 5 . GSA Actions . (a) The Administrator of General Services (Administrator) shall adhere to the policies and principles set forth in sections 2 and 4 of this order, and shall expeditiously update GSA policies and procedures to incorporate such policies and principles and advance the purposes of this order. (b) The Administrator shall: (i) ensure that GSA architects whose duties include reviewing, assisting with, or approving the selection of architects or designs for applicable Federal public buildings have formal training in, or substantial and significant experience with, classical or traditional architecture; (ii) create the position of senior advisor for architectural design, for an individual with specialized experience in classical architecture, to help develop GSA procedures, advise on architectural standards, and provide guidance during design evaluations or design juries; (iii) where the design of an applicable Federal public building is selected pursuant to a design-build competition under section 3309 of title 41, United States Code, list experience with classical or traditional architecture as specialized experience and technical competence in the phase-one solicitation, and give substantive weight to these factors when evaluating which offerors will be advanced to phase two; and (iv) consistent with sections 4302 and 4312 of title 5, United States Code, make advancing the purposes and implementing the policies of this order a critical performance element in the individual performance plans of the Chief Architect of GSA and appropriate subordinate employees in the GSA Public Buildings Service involved in selecting designs for applicable Federal public buildings (c) Where GSA intends to select a building design pursuant to a design competition, the Administrator shall actively recruit architectural firms and, as applicable, designers with experience in classical and traditional architecture to enter such competition and shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that multiple designs in such modes are advanced to the final evaluation round. (d) In the event the Administrator proposes to approve a design for a new applicable Federal public building that diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection 2(a) of this order, including Brutalist or Deconstructivist architecture or any design derived from or related to these types of architecture, the Administrator shall notify the President through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy not less than 30 days before GSA could reject such design without incurring substantial expenditures. Such notification shall set forth the reasons the Administrator proposes to approve such design, including: (i) a detailed explanation of why the Administrator believes selecting such design is justified, with particular focus on whether such design is as beautiful and reflective of the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American system of self-government as alternative designs using preferred architecture; (ii) the total expected cost of adopting the proposed design, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout its expected lifecycle; and (iii) a description of the designs using preferred architecture seriously considered for such project and the total expected cost of adopting such designs, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout their expected lifecycles. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the General Services Administration. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 28, 2025.

Tragically, one of the gravest threats to American lives is the drug overdose crisis, which has caused heartbreak and suffering on untold numbers of families. This Overdose Prevention Week, we remember those who lost their lives to overdose, we stand beside the families left to grieve, and we renew our solemn commitment to ending this epidemic once and for all. Under the previous administration, our country endured a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions on our southern border. Deadly drugs like fentanyl and other opioids flooded into our cities and towns, falling into the hands of our children, siblings, parents, friends, and neighbors, and leaving devastation in their wake. Over the past year, more than 80,000 of our fellow citizens have died from drug overdoses. Children have vanished from classrooms, parents from dinner tables, and entire neighborhoods have been shaken by unconscionable grief and sorrow. To combat this vicious assault on the American people, in July, I proudly signed into law the HALT Fentanyl Act, which classifies fentanyl-related compounds as Schedule I drugs. I also designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations &#8212; and with the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill, we are expanding the southern border wall and deporting violent drug traffickers who prey on our Nation&#8217;s most vulnerable. I will continue to do everything in my power to protect children and families, end the scourge of drug addiction, and keep lethal substances out of our communities and out of the hands of our citizens. During this week, my Administration calls on every American to protect themselves and their families from the perils of drug overdose. Preserving our American inheritance depends on freedom from danger, freedom from harm, and freedom to lead long, safe, and vigorous lives. My Administration will never stop fighting to achieve a future that protects its citizens, defends its communities, and ensures that the American people are happy, healthy, and free. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 31 through September 6, 2025, as Overdose Prevention Week. I call upon my fellow Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, religious services, and other activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and drug overdose epidemic and to consider concrete follow-up activities.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order: Section 1 . Background . On July 22, 2025, I announced a framework agreement between the United States and Japan (Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of United States-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and our shared national interests. The Agreement establishes a tariff framework that levels the playing field for American producers and accounts for American national security needs. In my judgment, the Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States. Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States.&nbsp; This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall United States trade position. Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year. The Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger vehicles without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense equipment. Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.&nbsp; These investments &#8212; which will be selected by the United States Government &#8212; will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations. In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962. Sec . 2 . General Tariffs . (a) The additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to products of Japan shall be determined by a product&#8217;s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (&#8220;Column 1 Duty Rate&#8221;). For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero percent. Treatment of specific or compound duty rates shall be identical to the treatment provided to products of the European Union as outlined in Executive Order 14326 of July 31, 2025 (Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates). The duties described in this subsection shall apply in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on products of Japan under Executive Order 14257, as amended. (b)&nbsp; Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply to products of Japan. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the United States Trade Representative; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC), shall determine whether modifications to the HTSUS are necessary or appropriate to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register . (d)&nbsp; The tariffs set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall apply retroactively to products of Japan entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025. &nbsp;Any refunds shall be processed pursuant to applicable laws and CBP&#8217;s standard procedures for such refunds. (e) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining what are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 3 . Aerospace . (a) With respect to products of Japan that fall under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except for unmanned aircraft, the tariffs imposed through the following Presidential actions and subsequent amendments to those actions shall no longer apply, as of the date of publication of the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b) of this section: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14257, as amended; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Proclamation 9704, as amended; (iii) &nbsp;Proclamation 9705, as amended; and (iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;Proclamation 10962. (b) &nbsp;Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register , the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining what are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 4 . Automobiles and Automobile Parts . (a) As of the date of publication of the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b) of this section, in lieu of the additional section 232 ad valorem duties imposed on products of Japan in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to an automobile or automobile part that is a product of Japan and subject to duties under Proclamation 10908, as amended, shall be determined by the product&#8217;s Column 1 Duty Rate. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty imposed shall be zero percent. (b) &nbsp;Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register , the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining whether automobiles and automobile parts are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 5 . Products Not Subject to Reciprocal Tariffs . (a) To implement the terms of the Agreement, the Secretary is authorized to modify the reciprocal tariff rate imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, to zero percent for products of Japan that are natural resources unavailable (or unavailable at sufficient scale to satisfy domestic demand) in the United States, generic pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceutical ingredients, and generic pharmaceutical chemical precursors. (b) &nbsp;In determining when and for which products to modify the reciprocal tariff rate to zero percent, the Secretary shall act in a manner consistent with the national interests of the United States; the purposes of this order; the need to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended; and the need to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security that I found pursuant to section 232.&nbsp; The Secretary shall also consider factors he deems appropriate, including the scope and nature of the commitments of the Government of Japan under the Agreement; the scope and nature of the commitments of the United States under the Agreement; the actions taken by the Government of Japan to implement its commitments under the Agreement; and the actions taken by the United States to implement its commitments under the Agreement. Sec . 6 . Monitoring and Modifications . (a) The Secretary shall monitor the progress of Japan&#8217;s implementation of its commitments under the Agreement and shall, from time to time, update me on the status of Japan&#8217;s implementation. (b)&nbsp; Should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the Agreement, I may modify this order as necessary to deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962. Sec . 7 . Delegation . (a) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order &#8212; including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or through notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance &#8212; and to employ all powers granted to the President, including those granted by IEEPA and section 232, as may be necessary to implement and effectuate this order. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC, shall determine whether additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with any senior officials she deems appropriate. (c) &nbsp;Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within their respective department or agency. (d) All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec . 8 . Interaction With Other Presidential Actions . Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions directed in this order is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. Sec . 9 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Commerce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Background . The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government&#8217;s ability to respond effectively. This situation has become dire in one of our Nation&#8217;s most historic cities. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memphis in 2024 had the highest rate of violent crime per capita, including some of the highest per capita rates of murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, and property crimes such as burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft, in the country. The city, a beacon of American culture that was Elvis&#8217;s home and is often called the birthplace of rock and roll and the blues, should be safe and secure for all of its citizens and Americans who visit its historic landmarks such as Graceland, Beale Street, and the Memphis Pyramid. To restore public safety and order, State and local leaders have requested Federal assistance, and I will act quickly to ensure that Federal authorities assist Memphis law enforcement to the fullest possible extent. Sec . 2 . Memphis Safe Task Force .

Background . The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government’s ability to respond effectively. This situation has become dire in one of our Nation’s most historic cities. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memphis in 2024 had the highest rate of violent crime per capita, including some of the highest per capita rates of murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, and property crimes such as burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft, in the country. The city, a beacon of American culture that was Elvis’s home and is often called the birthplace of rock and roll and the blues, should be safe and secure for all of its citizens and Americans who visit its historic landmarks such as Graceland, Beale Street, and the Memphis Pyramid. To restore public safety and order, State and local leaders have requested Federal assistance, and I will act quickly to ensure that Federal authorities assist Memphis law enforcement to the fullest possible extent. Sec . 2 . Memphis Safe Task Force .

The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. Information technology (IT) firms in particular have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields. The share of IT workers in the H-1B program grew from 32 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to an average of over 65 percent in the last 5 fiscal years. In addition, some of the most prolific H-1B employers are now consistently IT outsourcing companies. Using these H 1B-reliant IT outsourcing companies provides significant savings for employers: one study of tech workers showed a 36 percent discount for H-1B &#8220;entry-level&#8221; positions as compared to full-time, traditional workers. To take advantage of artificially low labor costs incentivized by the program, companies close their IT divisions, fire their American staff, and outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign workers. Further, the abuse of the H-1B visa program has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers. These effects of abuse of H-1B visas have coincided with increasing challenges in the labor market in which H-1B workers serve. According to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively &#8212; more than double the unemployment rates of recent biology and art history graduates. Recent data reveals that unemployment rates among workers in computer occupations jumped from an average of 1.98 percent in 2019 to 3.02 percent in 2025. Reports also indicate that many American tech companies have laid off their qualified and highly skilled American workers and simultaneously hired thousands of H-1B workers. One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. American IT workers have reported they were forced to train the foreign workers who were taking their jobs and to sign nondisclosure agreements about this indignity as a condition of receiving any form of severance. This suggests H-1B visas are not being used to fill occupational shortages or obtain highly skilled workers who are unavailable in the United States. The high numbers of relatively low-wage workers in the H-1B program undercut the integrity of the program and are detrimental to American workers&#8217; wages and labor opportunities, especially at the entry level, in industries where such low-paid H-1B workers are concentrated. These abuses also prevent American employers in other industries from utilizing the H-1B program in the manner in which it was intended: to fill jobs for which highly skilled and educated American workers are unavailable. The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States. Further, abuses of the H-1B program present a national security threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields. A 2017 study showed that wages for American computer scientists would have been 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent higher and employment in computer science for American workers would have been 6.1 percent to 10.8 percent higher in 2001 absent the importation of foreign workers into the computer science field. It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers. The severe harms that the large-scale abuse of this program has inflicted on our economic and national security demands an immediate response. I therefore find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of certain foreign workers who are described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States because such entry would harm American workers, including by undercutting their wages. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Restriction on Entry . (a) Pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), the entry into the United States of aliens as nonimmigrants to perform services in a specialty occupation under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), is restricted, except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000 &#8212; subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section. This restriction shall expire, absent extension, 12 months after the effective date of this proclamation, which shall be 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall restrict decisions on petitions not accompanied by a $100,000 payment for H-1B specialty occupation workers under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, who are currently outside the United States, for 12 months following the effective date of this proclamation as set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary of State shall also issue guidance, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, to prevent misuse of B visas by alien beneficiaries of approved H-1B petitions that have an employment start date beginning prior to October 1, 2026. (c) The restriction imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to any individual alien, all aliens working for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary&#8217;s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B specialty occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. Sec . 2 . Compliance . (a) Employers shall, prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of an alien outside the United States, obtain and retain documentation showing that the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation has been made. (b) The Secretary of State shall verify receipt of payment of the amount described in section 1 of this proclamation during the H-1B visa petition process and shall approve only those visa petitions for which the filing employer has made the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation. (c) The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement this proclamation and to deny entry to the United States to any H-1B nonimmigrant for whom the prospective employer has not made the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation. Sec . 3 . Scope and Implementation of Restriction on Entry . (a) The restriction on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall apply only to aliens who enter or attempt to enter the United States after the effective date of this proclamation as set forth in section 1(a) of this proclamation. (b) No later than 30 days following the completion of the H-1B lottery that immediately follows this proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, a recommendation on whether an extension or renewal of the restriction on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation is in the interests of the United States. Sec . 4 . Amending the Prevailing Wage Levels . (a) The Secretary of Labor shall initiate a rulemaking to revise the prevailing wage levels to levels consistent with the policy goals of this proclamation consistent with section 212(n) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(n). (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the admission as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high-paid aliens, consistent with sections 101, 212, and 214 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1182, and 1184. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. Information technology (IT) firms in particular have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields. The share of IT workers in the H-1B program grew from 32 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to an average of over 65 percent in the last 5 fiscal years. In addition, some of the most prolific H-1B employers are now consistently IT outsourcing companies. Using these H 1B-reliant IT outsourcing companies provides significant savings for employers: one study of tech workers showed a 36 percent discount for H-1B “entry-level” positions as compared to full-time, traditional workers. To take advantage of artificially low labor costs incentivized by the program, companies close their IT divisions, fire their American staff, and outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign workers. Further, the abuse of the H-1B visa program has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers. These effects of abuse of H-1B visas have coincided with increasing challenges in the labor market in which H-1B workers serve. According to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively — more than double the unemployment rates of recent biology and art history graduates. Recent data reveals that unemployment rates among workers in computer occupations jumped from an average of 1.98 percent in 2019 to 3.02 percent in 2025. Reports also indicate that many American tech companies have laid off their qualified and highly skilled American workers and simultaneously hired thousands of H-1B workers. One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. American IT workers have reported they were forced to train the foreign workers who were taking their jobs and to sign nondisclosure agreements about this indignity as a condition of receiving any form of severance. This suggests H-1B visas are not being used to fill occupational shortages or obtain highly skilled workers who are unavailable in the United States. The high numbers of relatively low-wage workers in the H-1B program undercut the integrity of the program and are detrimental to American workers’ wages and labor opportunities, especially at the entry level, in industries where such low-paid H-1B workers are concentrated. These abuses also prevent American employers in other industries from utilizing the H-1B program in the manner in which it was intended: to fill jobs for which highly skilled and educated American workers are unavailable. The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States. Further, abuses of the H-1B program present a national security threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields.

Purpose . My Administration has worked relentlessly to undo the disastrous immigration policies of the prior administration. Those policies produced a deluge of immigrants, without serious consideration of how those immigrants would affect America&#8217;s interests. Most significantly, the prior administration permitted millions of aliens to enter the United States illegally, to the detriment of public safety, national security, and the rule of law. International cartels, transnational criminal organizations, terrorists, and foreign malign actors took advantage of those open borders policies. The prior administration also permitted abuse of the refugee process, swamping towns and cities with aliens and, in some cases, forcing them to declare emergencies to combat the crisis. It is a priority of my Administration to realign Federal immigration policy with the Nation&#8217;s interests by ending illegal immigration and prioritizing the admission of aliens who will affirmatively benefit the Nation, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and businessmen and women. To advance that policy, I hereby announce the Gold Card, a visa program overseen by the Secretary of Commerce that will facilitate the entry of aliens who have demonstrated their ability and desire to advance the interests of the United States by voluntarily providing a significant financial gift to the Nation. Sec . 2 . The Gold Card . (a) The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall establish a &#8220;Gold Card&#8221; program authorizing an alien who makes an unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce under 15 U.S.C. 1522 (or for whom a corporation or similar entity makes such a gift) to establish eligibility for an immigrant visa using an expedited process, to the extent consistent with law and public safety and national security concerns. The requisite gift amount shall be $1 million for an individual donating on his or her own behalf and $2 million for a corporation or similar entity donating on behalf of an individual. (b) In adjudicating visa applications, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, treat the gift specified in subsection (a) of this section as evidence of eligibility under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business ability and national benefit under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(A), and of eligibility for a national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(B). (c) The Secretary of Commerce shall deposit the gifts contributed under subsection (a) of this section in a separate fund in the Department of the Treasury and use them to promote commerce and American industry, consistent with the statutory authorities of the Department of Commerce, see, e.g. , 15 U.S.C. 1512. Sec . 3 . Implementation . The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Gold Card program. Among other things, they shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law and their respective statutory authorities, including the limits on the numbers of visas specified in 8 U.S.C. 1151 et seq. : (a) Establish a process for application and expedited adjudication of Gold Card petitions, visa issuance, and adjustment of status. (b) Specify the date on which applicants (or sponsors if applicable) may begin to submit gifts for consideration under the Gold Card program. (c) Establish a process for a Gold Card holder sponsored by a corporation or similar entity to abandon his or her status and for the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the original gift as evidence of eligibility under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business ability and national benefit under 8 U.S.C. 1153 (b)(2)(A), and of eligibility for a national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(B), for a different individual specified by the corporation or similar entity. The transferee shall otherwise be subject to the same procedures as an original visa applicant, including appropriate screening for public safety and national security. (d) Establish administrative fees to cover the cost of expedited processing under subsection (a) of this section. (e) Establish maintenance and transfer fees for corporations or similar entities sponsoring individuals under the Gold Card program. (f) Consider expanding the Gold Card program to visa applicants under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5). Sec . 4 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person, is held to be invalid, the remaining provisions and applications shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Commerce. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September 19, 2025.

(a) The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall establish a “Gold Card” program authorizing an alien who makes an unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce under 15 U.S.C. 1522 (or for whom a corporation or similar entity makes such a gift) to establish eligibility for an immigrant visa using an expedited process, to the extent consistent with law and public safety and national security concerns. The requisite gift amount shall be $1 million for an individual donating on his or her own behalf and $2 million for a corporation or similar entity donating on behalf of an individual. (b) In adjudicating visa applications, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, treat the gift specified in subsection (a) of this section as evidence of eligibility under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business ability and national benefit under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(A), and of eligibility for a national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(B). (c) The Secretary of Commerce shall deposit the gifts contributed under subsection (a) of this section in a separate fund in the Department of the Treasury and use them to promote commerce and American industry, consistent with the statutory authorities of the Department of Commerce, see, e.g. , 15 U.S.C. 1512. Sec . 3 . Implementation . The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Gold Card program. Among other things, they shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law and their respective statutory authorities, including the limits on the numbers of visas specified in 8 U.S.C. 1151 et seq. : (a) Establish a process for application and expedited adjudication of Gold Card petitions, visa issuance, and adjustment of status. (b) Specify the date on which applicants (or sponsors if applicable) may begin to submit gifts for consideration under the Gold Card program. (c) Establish a process for a Gold Card holder sponsored by a corporation or similar entity to abandon his or her status and for the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the original gift as evidence of eligibility under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business ability and national benefit under 8 U.S.C. 1153 (b)(2)(A), and of eligibility for a national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(B), for a different individual specified by the corporation or similar entity. The transferee shall otherwise be subject to the same procedures as an original visa applicant, including appropriate screening for public safety and national security. (d) Establish administrative fees to cover the cost of expedited processing under subsection (a) of this section. (e) Establish maintenance and transfer fees for corporations or similar entities sponsoring individuals under the Gold Card program. (f) Consider expanding the Gold Card program to visa applicants under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5). Sec . 4 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person, is held to be invalid, the remaining provisions and applications shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Commerce. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 19, 2025.

Antifa as a Terrorist Threat . Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law. It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals. This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members. Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech. This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism. Sec . 2 . Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization .

Background . Federal law provides for the death penalty for criminals found guilty of especially aggravated crimes (18 U.S.C. 3591(a )). Capital punishment is an essential part of how our justice system deters and punishes the most reprehensible crimes that often involve grotesque and lethal violence against innocent Americans. Restoring Federal capital punishment has been a priority for my Administration since its first day under Executive Order 14164 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety).&nbsp; This priority warrants particular emphasis given the public safety threats in our Nation&#8217;s capital, as described in Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia).&nbsp; My Administration has undertaken numerous successful actions to address the emergency declared and to protect public safety, as a result of which crime in the District of Columbia has fallen dramatically in recent weeks.&nbsp; Faithful implementation of the capital punishment laws will be part of this continuing work. Sec . 2 . Enforcing the Law Relating to Capital Punishment . (a) The Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall fully enforce Federal law with respect to capital punishment in the District of Columbia by seeking the death penalty in all appropriate cases where, following full examination of the evidence and other relevant information, the applicable factors justify a sentence of death. (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall, to the maximum degree practicable, pursue Federal jurisdiction with respect to cases involving crimes committed in the District of Columbia for which the death penalty is available under Federal law.

Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence . Heinous assassinations and other acts of political violence in the United States have dramatically increased in recent years. Even in the aftermath of the horrifying assassination of Charlie Kirk, some individuals who adhered to the alleged shooter&#8217;s ideology embraced and cheered this evil murder while actively encouraging more political violence. This was preceded by the 2024 assassination of a senior healthcare executive and the 2022 assassination attempt against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Two separate assassination attempts against my own life in less than 3 months took place during the 2024 Presidential election cycle. Riots in Los Angeles and Portland reflect a more than 1,000 percent increase in attacks on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers since January 21, 2025, compared to the same period last year. Just yesterday, a shooting targeting an ICE facility in Dallas resulted in multiple casualties. Separate anti-police and &#8220;criminal justice&#8221; riots have left many people dead and injured and inflicted over $2 billion in property damage nationwide. This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. &nbsp;Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns of targeted intimidation, radicalization, threats, and violence designed to silence opposing speech, limit political activity, change or direct policy outcomes, and prevent the functioning of a democratic society.&nbsp; A new law enforcement strategy that investigates all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies &#8212; including the organized structures, networks, entities, organizations, funding sources, and predicate actions behind them &#8212; is required.&nbsp; These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions. These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them. As in the case of several ICE agents in Los Angeles being doxed, the goal of these campaigns can be to obstruct the operations of the Federal Government as well as aid and abet criminal activity the Federal Government is lawfully pursuing. These campaigns are coordinated and perpetrated by actors who have developed a comprehensive strategy to achieve specific policy goals through radicalization and violent intimidation. There are common recurrent motivations and indicia uniting this pattern of violent and terroristic activities under the umbrella of self-described &#8220;anti-fascism.&#8221;&nbsp; These movements portray foundational American principles (e.g., support for law enforcement and border control) as &#8220;fascist&#8221; to justify and encourage acts of violent revolution.&nbsp; This &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental American liberties.&nbsp; Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality. &nbsp;As described in the Order of September 22, 2025 (Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization), the groups and entities that perpetuate this extremism have created a movement that embraces and elevates violence to achieve policy outcomes, including justifying additional assassinations.&nbsp; For example, Charlie Kirk&#8217;s alleged assassin engraved the bullets used in the murder with so-called &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; rhetoric. &nbsp; The United States requires a national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts. Through this comprehensive strategy, law enforcement will disband and uproot networks, entities, and organizations that promote organized violence, violent intimidation, conspiracies against rights, and other efforts to disrupt the functioning of a democratic society. Sec . 2 . Investigating Domestic Terrorist Organizations . (a) The National Joint Terrorism Task Force and its local offices (collectively, &#8220;JTTFs&#8221;) shall coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law. This strategy shall include the investigatory and prosecutorial measures set forth in this section. (b) &nbsp;The JTTFs shall investigate potential Federal crimes relating to acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons for the purpose of: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; political violence, terrorism, or conspiracy against rights; or (ii)&nbsp; the violent deprivation of any citizen&#8217;s rights. (c) &nbsp;The JTTFs shall also investigate: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; institutional and individual funders, and officers and employees of organizations, that are responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet the principal actors engaging in the criminal conduct described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section; and (ii)&nbsp; non-governmental organizations and American citizens residing abroad or with close ties to foreign governments, agents, citizens, foundations, or influence networks engaged in violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. 611 et seq .) or money laundering by funding, creating, or supporting entities that engage in activities that support or encourage domestic terrorism. (d) &nbsp;The JTTFs shall consult and coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies) as needed to determine whether such agencies can apply existing authorities or exercise their own authorities, as appropriate, to support the JTTFs&#8217; investigations and relevant prosecutions of political violence. (e)&nbsp; The JTTFs may, to the extent permitted by law, request operational assistance from and coordinate with law enforcement partners when investigating domestic terrorism. (f)&nbsp; The National Joint Terrorism Task Force shall provide regular progress updates to the President through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor.&nbsp; (g) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall direct the Department of Justice to prosecute all Federal crimes, to the maximum extent permissible by law, related to the investigations described in subsections (a) through (c) of this section. (h) The Attorney General shall issue specific guidance that ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder. This guidance shall also include an identification of any behaviors, fact patterns, recurrent motivations, or other indicia common to organizations and entities that coordinate these acts in order to direct efforts to identify and prevent potential violent activity. (i)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), in coordination with the Attorney General, shall make available all resources, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to identify and disrupt financial networks that fund domestic terrorism and political violence. &nbsp;The Secretary, acting through the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Office of the Department of the Treasury, shall deploy investigative tools, examine financial flows, and coordinate with partner agencies to trace illicit funding streams.&nbsp; The Secretary shall provide guidance for financial institutions to file Suspicious Activity Reports and investigate indicia of illicit funding streams to ensure such activity is rooted out at the source and referred for law enforcement action, as appropriate. (j)&nbsp; The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (Commissioner) shall take action to ensure that no tax-exempt entities are directly or indirectly financing political violence or domestic terrorism. &nbsp;In addition, where applicable, the Commissioner shall ensure that the Internal Revenue Service refers such organizations, and the employees and officers of such organizations, to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution. (k) &nbsp;All Federal law enforcement agencies with investigative authority shall question and interrogate, within&nbsp;all lawful authorities, individuals engaged in political violence or lawlessness regarding the entity or individual organizing such actions and any related financial sponsorship of those actions prior to adjudication or initiation of a plea agreement. &nbsp;Investigations should prioritize crimes such as the following: &nbsp;assaulting Federal officers or employees or otherwise engaging in conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. 111; conspiracy against rights under 18 U.S.C. 241; conspiracy to commit offense under 18 U.S.C. 371 ; solicitation to commit a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. 373; money laundering under 18&nbsp;U.S.C. 1956; funding of terrorist acts or otherwise facilitating terrorism under 18&nbsp;U.S.C. 2339, 2339A, 2339B, 2339C, and 2339D; arson offenses under 18 U.S.C. 844; violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. 1961&nbsp; et seq. ); and major fraud against the United States under 18 U.S.C. 1031. (l) &nbsp;All Federal law enforcement agencies with investigative authority shall adopt strategies similar to those used to address violent crime and organized crime to disrupt and dismantle entire networks of criminal activity. Sec . 3 . Department of Justice Designation . In the course of and as a result of the investigations directed by section 2 of this memorandum, the Attorney General may recommend that any group or entity whose members are engaged in activities meeting the definition of &#8220;domestic terrorism&#8221; in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5) merits designation as a &#8220;domestic terrorist organization.&#8221; The Attorney General shall submit a list of any such groups or entities to the President through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor. Sec . 4 . Domestic Terrorism as a National Priority Area . The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall designate domestic terrorism a national priority area and develop appropriate grant programs to allocate funding for law enforcement partners to detect, prevent, and protect against threats arising from this area. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp; (c)&nbsp; This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (1) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (2) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications.&nbsp; Section 2(g) of the Act defines &#8220;foreign adversary controlled application&#8221; to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd., TikTok, or certain subsidiaries.&nbsp; Under section 2(a), the Act&#8217;s prohibitions with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025.&nbsp; On January 20, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14166 (Application of Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok), delaying the Act&#8217;s enforcement until April 5, 2025. &nbsp;On April 4, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14258 (Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act&#8217;s enforcement until June 19, 2025.&nbsp; On June 19, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14310 (Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act&#8217;s enforcement until September 17, 2025.&nbsp; Finally, on September 16, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14350 (Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act&#8217;s enforcement until December 16, 2025. Section 2(c) of the Act further empowers the President to determine, through an interagency process, that TikTok has undergone a &#8220;qualified divestiture,&#8221; removing the Act&#8217;s prohibitions.&nbsp; To achieve a &#8220;qualified divestiture,&#8221; TikTok must execute a transaction that would result in the application no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary and that would preclude formerly affiliated entities from maintaining an &#8220;operational relationship&#8221; with the application&#8217;s United States operations. &nbsp;The Act describes &#8220;operational relationship&#8221; to include &#8220;cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm&#8221; and an &#8220;agreement with respect to data sharing.&#8221; A plan has been presented to me to undergo a qualified divestiture of TikTok&#8217;s United States operations, as outlined in a framework agreement (Framework Agreement). &nbsp;Under this Framework Agreement, TikTok&#8217;s United States application will be operated by a newly established joint venture based in the United States. &nbsp;It will be majority-owned and controlled by United States persons and will no longer be controlled by any foreign adversary, since ByteDance Ltd. and its affiliates will own less than 20 percent of the entity, with the remainder being held by certain investors (Investor Parties). &nbsp;This new joint venture will be run by a new board of directors and subject to rules that appropriately protect Americans&#8217; data and our national security.&nbsp; Accordingly, I have determined that the proposed divestiture would allow the millions of Americans who enjoy TikTok every day to continue using it while also protecting national security. Sec . 2 . Determination . (a) Under the Act, the President&#8217;s determination that a divestiture is a &#8220;qualified divestiture&#8221; must occur through an &#8220;interagency process.&#8221; As delegated and directed by me, the Vice President has led this interagency process in cooperation and consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties. This interagency process has reviewed and made recommendations to me with respect to all aspects of the proposed divestiture. (b)&nbsp; Having completed the interagency process contemplated in the Act, I have determined the following: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The TikTok application is a social media platform, centered around short video clips, used by about 170 million Americans.&nbsp; More than simply providing entertainment, many American content creators rely on the TikTok application for their livelihood and many American businesses rely on it for their advertising. (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;The Congress passed the Act in response to concerns from the United States national security community that the TikTok application is under the control of a foreign adversary.&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; The divestiture proposed in the Framework Agreement resolves these national security concerns and complies with the Act because it removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the &#8220;control&#8221; of a foreign adversary and precludes any &#8220;operational relationship&#8221; between a formerly affiliated entity controlled by a foreign adversary and the new joint venture. (A)&nbsp; First, the divestiture removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the control of a foreign adversary, as defined under the Act, because, among other things, the new joint venture would be based in the United States and less than 20 percent of the joint venture would be owned or controlled by foreign adversary entities or persons. (B)&nbsp; Second, the divestiture puts the operation of the algorithms and code, as well as content-moderation decisions, under the control of the new joint venture. (C)&nbsp; Third, the divestiture prohibits the storage of sensitive United States user data in a manner that would place such data under the control of a foreign adversary and requires such data be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company. (D)&nbsp; Fourth, the divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates, algorithms, and data flows by the United States&#8217; trusted security partners, and it requires all recommendation models, including algorithms, that use United States user data to be retrained and monitored by those trusted security partners. (iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it. (c)&nbsp; Based on these findings, I further determine that the divestiture of the applications outlined in the Framework Agreement, once its implementation agreements are executed, is a &#8220;qualified divestiture&#8221; under the Act, including with respect to the TikTok applications, the Lemon8 application, the CapCut applications, any other application or website duly operated by the new joint venture, and their associated or affiliated websites. Sec . 3 . Action . (a) To permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed, the Attorney General shall not take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 120 days from the date of this order. During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating of) any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the issuance of this order. (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. (c)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall issue a letter to appropriate providers stating that there has been no violation of the Act and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurs during the 120-day period specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this order. (d)&nbsp; Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests the sole authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive&#8217;s exclusive authority to enforce the Act, including the President&#8217;s determination of a qualified divestiture. (e) &nbsp;The Attorney General or the Attorney General&#8217;s designee shall serve as the United States Government&#8217;s representative under the Framework Agreement.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall receive any information from the new joint venture, trusted security partners, or any other party from whom information is provided pursuant to the Framework Agreement and this order on behalf of the United States Government.&nbsp; Trusted security partners may also share information with other United States Government officials.&nbsp; Sec . 4 . Amendment and Revocation . The Presidential Memorandum of July 24, 2024 (Delegation of Authority Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act), is hereby revoked. As described in this order, I have determined that the divestiture outlined in the Framework Agreement constitutes a &#8220;qualified divestiture&#8221; under the Act and resolves the national security concerns the Act addresses. I further determine that: (a) &nbsp;The Order of August 14, 2020 (Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.) (Divestment Order), expressly reserved my authority to issue further orders with respect to ByteDance Ltd., Musical.ly, Musical.ly in the United States, and TikTok Inc. as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security.&nbsp; The threatened impairment to the national security described in the Divestment Order can be adequately mitigated if, after, or in conjunction with, the execution of the Framework Agreement&#8217;s implementation agreements, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) enters into an agreement with certain Investor Parties that ensures the alignment of the economic incentives of such Investor Parties with compliance with the terms of the Framework Agreement to protect national security.&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The agreement described in subsection (a) of this section also resolves any national security concern under section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565) (section 721) arising from the acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd. as modified by the divestiture outlined in the Framework Agreement. (c) &nbsp;On the basis of the findings set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, considering the factors described in subsection (f) of section 721, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2(b) of the Divestment Order is amended to read as follows in its entirety:&nbsp; &#8220;The prohibition in subsection (a) of this section shall cease to be in effect if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) executes an agreement with certain investors, consistent with the Executive Order of September 25, 2025 (Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security).&#8221;. (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 2(g) of the Divestment Order is redesignated as section 2(c) and amended to read as follows in its entirety:&nbsp; &#8220;Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, the Attorney General, in consultation with CFIUS, is authorized to implement measures the Attorney General deems necessary and appropriate to verify compliance with the agreement described in subsection (b) of this section.&#8221;. (iii)&nbsp; Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Divestment Order are stricken, and sections 2(f), 2(h), and 2(i) of the Divestment Order are redesignated as sections 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f), respectively. Sec . 5 . Reservation . I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to this matter as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Background . The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the “Act”) (Public Law 118-50, Div. H) regulates “foreign adversary controlled applications,” specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds. Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (1) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (2) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications. Section 2(g) of the Act defines “foreign adversary controlled application” to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd., TikTok, or certain subsidiaries. Under section 2(a), the Act’s prohibitions with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025. On January 20, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14166 (Application of Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok), delaying the Act’s enforcement until April 5, 2025. On April 4, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14258 (Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act’s enforcement until June 19, 2025. On June 19, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14310 (Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act’s enforcement until September 17, 2025. Finally, on September 16, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14350 (Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay), further delaying the Act’s enforcement until December 16, 2025. Section 2(c) of the Act further empowers the President to determine, through an interagency process, that TikTok has undergone a “qualified divestiture,” removing the Act’s prohibitions. To achieve a “qualified divestiture,” TikTok must execute a transaction that would result in the application no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary and that would preclude formerly affiliated entities from maintaining an “operational relationship” with the application’s United States operations. The Act describes “operational relationship” to include “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm” and an “agreement with respect to data sharing.” A plan has been presented to me to undergo a qualified divestiture of TikTok’s United States operations, as outlined in a framework agreement (Framework Agreement). Under this Framework Agreement, TikTok’s United States application will be operated by a newly established joint venture based in the United States. It will be majority-owned and controlled by United States persons and will no longer be controlled by any foreign adversary, since ByteDance Ltd. and its affiliates will own less than 20 percent of the entity, with the remainder being held by certain investors (Investor Parties). This new joint venture will be run by a new board of directors and subject to rules that appropriately protect Americans’ data and our national security. Accordingly, I have determined that the proposed divestiture would allow the millions of Americans who enjoy TikTok every day to continue using it while also protecting national security. Sec . 2 . Determination . (a) Under the Act, the President’s determination that a divestiture is a “qualified divestiture” must occur through an “interagency process.” As delegated and directed by me, the Vice President has led this interagency process in cooperation and consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

This interagency process has reviewed and made recommendations to me with respect to all aspects of the proposed divestiture.

More than simply providing entertainment, many American content creators rely on the TikTok application for their livelihood and many American businesses rely on it for their advertising. (ii) The Congress passed the Act in response to concerns from the United States national security community that the TikTok application is under the control of a foreign adversary. (iii) The divestiture proposed in the Framework Agreement resolves these national security concerns and complies with the Act because it removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the “control” of a foreign adversary and precludes any “operational relationship” between a formerly affiliated entity controlled by a foreign adversary and the new joint venture. (A) First, the divestiture removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the control of a foreign adversary, as defined under the Act, because, among other things, the new joint venture would be based in the United States and less than 20 percent of the joint venture would be owned or controlled by foreign adversary entities or persons. (B) Second, the divestiture puts the operation of the algorithms and code, as well as content-moderation decisions, under the control of the new joint venture. (C) Third, the divestiture prohibits the storage of sensitive United States user data in a manner that would place such data under the control of a foreign adversary and requires such data be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company. (D) Fourth, the divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates, algorithms, and data flows by the United States’ trusted security partners, and it requires all recommendation models, including algorithms, that use United States user data to be retrained and monitored by those trusted security partners. (iv) These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it.

Sec . 3 . Action . (a) To permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed, the Attorney General shall not take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 120 days from the date of this order. During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating of) any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the issuance of this order. (b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. (c) The Attorney General shall issue a letter to appropriate providers stating that there has been no violation of the Act and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurs during the 120-day period specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this order. (d) Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests the sole authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive. The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive’s exclusive authority to enforce the Act, including the President’s determination of a qualified divestiture. (e) The Attorney General or the Attorney General’s designee shall serve as the United States Government’s representative under the Framework Agreement. The Attorney General shall receive any information from the new joint venture, trusted security partners, or any other party from whom information is provided pursuant to the Framework Agreement and this order on behalf of the United States Government. Trusted security partners may also share information with other United States Government officials. Sec . 4 . Amendment and Revocation . The Presidential Memorandum of July 24, 2024 (Delegation of Authority Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act), is hereby revoked. As described in this order, I have determined that the divestiture outlined in the Framework Agreement constitutes a “qualified divestiture” under the Act and resolves the national security concerns the Act addresses. I further determine that: (a) The Order of August 14, 2020 (Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.) (Divestment Order), expressly reserved my authority to issue further orders with respect to ByteDance Ltd., Musical.ly, Musical.ly in the United States, and TikTok Inc. as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security. The threatened impairment to the national security described in the Divestment Order can be adequately mitigated if, after, or in conjunction with, the execution of the Framework Agreement’s implementation agreements, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) enters into an agreement with certain Investor Parties that ensures the alignment of the economic incentives of such Investor Parties with compliance with the terms of the Framework Agreement to protect national security. (b) The agreement described in subsection (a) of this section also resolves any national security concern under section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565) (section 721) arising from the acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd. as modified by the divestiture outlined in the Framework Agreement. (c) On the basis of the findings set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, considering the factors described in subsection (f) of section 721, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (i) Section 2(b) of the Divestment Order is amended to read as follows in its entirety: “The prohibition in subsection (a) of this section shall cease to be in effect if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) executes an agreement with certain investors, consistent with the Executive Order of September 25, 2025 (Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security).”. (ii) Section 2(g) of the Divestment Order is redesignated as section 2(c) and amended to read as follows in its entirety: “Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, the Attorney General, in consultation with CFIUS, is authorized to implement measures the Attorney General deems necessary and appropriate to verify compliance with the agreement described in subsection (b) of this section.”. (iii) Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Divestment Order are stricken, and sections 2(f), 2(h), and 2(i) of the Divestment Order are redesignated as sections 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f), respectively. Sec . 5 . Reservation . I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to this matter as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security. Sec . 6 . General Provisions .

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The Secretary found that present quantities and circumstances of wood product imports are weakening our economy, resulting in the persistent threats of closures of wood mills and disruptions of wood product supply chains, among other things, and diminishing the utilization of production capacity of our domestic wood industry. Because of the state of the United States wood industry, the United States may be unable to meet demands for wood products that are crucial to the national defense and critical infrastructure. Taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security and other relevant factors, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of the imports of wood products threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232. 3. In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary found that wood products serve as essential inputs across multiple sectors, supporting national defense, critical infrastructure, economic stability, and industrial resilience in the United States. 4. The Secretary found that wood products are used in critical functions of the Department of War, including building infrastructure for operational testing, housing and storage for personnel and materiel, transporting munitions, as an ingredient in munitions, and as a component in missile-defense systems and thermal-protection systems for nuclear-reentry vehicles. Further, the Secretary found that wood products support multiple critical infrastructure sectors of the United States, sectors that involve assets, systems, and networks considered so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on the national security, economic welfare, or national public health or safety of the United States. Wood products are particularly important to communications, energy, transportation, defense, and manufacturing, especially in supporting the United States power grid and transportation infrastructure. 5. The Secretary also found that while the United States possesses ample raw materials and industrial capacity to meet domestic wood products demand, wood production in the United States remains underdeveloped. At the same time, imports of wood products continue to rise, signaling foreign dependence and creating vulnerabilities in the domestic industry. Foreign subsidies and unfair trade practices are eroding the competitiveness of the United States wood products industry and disincentivizing investment and modernization. These circumstances have weakened domestic manufacturing capacity for wood products, and have increased reliance on foreign imports, weakening United States industrial resilience and placing national security and economic stability at risk. 6. The Secretary identified that these practices are threatening the United States wood products industry in a way that increases mill closures and weakens domestic capacity and employment across the United States. These closures and the attendant loss of jobs will raise costs and could inhibit the United States from fulfilling its national-security needs and demands for wood products. 7. In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a range of actions, including actions to adjust the imports of wood products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States . 8. After considering the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232 (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information, I concur with the Secretary&#8217;s finding that wood products are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In my judgment, and in light of the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d) (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information, I also determine that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt a plan of action that imposes tariffs, as described below, to adjust imports of wood products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 9. In my judgment, the actions in this proclamation will, among other things, strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create high-quality jobs, and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products such that the United States can fully satisfy domestic consumption while also creating economic benefits through increased exports. These actions will also encourage capital investment and drive innovation across the United States wood products industry, and strengthen the ability of the military and national-defense industry to domestically produce key munitions and defense systems and perform other required critical national-security functions. Modernization and renewed investment will curb further erosion of the United States wood industry and improve its efficiency, resource utilization, and product yield. These actions will adjust the imports of wood products and are necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of such articles. 10. To ensure the tariffs on wood products in this proclamation are not circumvented or that the purpose of this action to eliminate the threat to the national security of the United States by imports of wood products is not undermined, I deem it necessary and appropriate to establish processes to identify and impose tariffs on additional wood products, as further described below. 11. To ensure the effectiveness of the actions in this proclamation, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to address undervaluation, as further described below. In my judgment, when there is a threat of undervaluation, it may be appropriate for specific, compound, or mixed tariffs to be imposed. 12. Consistent with the General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (May 8, 2025), the United States intends to coordinate with the United Kingdom to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing the national security threat in the wood-products industry. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the framework agreements I have negotiated with the European Union and Japan, I intend to ensure that the tariff rate that applies to originating wood‑products of the European Union and Japan subject to this proclamation shall not exceed 15 percent. 13. Section 232 authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. Section 232 includes the authority to adopt and carry out a plan of action, with adjustments over time, to address the national-security threat. That initial plan of action may include negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners along with other actions to adjust imports to address the national security threat, including tariffs. If action under section 232 includes the negotiation of an agreement, such as one contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i), 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i), then section 232 also directs the President to take other actions he deems necessary to adjust imports and eliminate the threat that the imported article poses to national security if such an agreement is not entered into within 180 days of the date of this proclamation or is not being carried out or is ineffective, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A). 14. The Secretary and the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) have advised me that there are ongoing negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners that at least in part include discussions over wood products. In my judgment, and after considering the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the additional information provided to me by the Secretary and the Trade Representative, and other relevant factors and information, I have decided to include in my plan of action negotiations, with adjustments to tariffs depending on the status or outcome of such negotiations. I therefore direct the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, to pursue negotiation of agreements or continue current negotiations of agreements, such as agreements contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i), 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i), to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imported wood products. 15. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483 (section 604), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. ) (IEEPA), section 604, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of softwood timber and lumber, as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation, shall be subject to a 10 percent ad valorem duty rate. (2) &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of certain upholstered wooden products, as listed in Annex I to this proclamation, will be subject to a 25 percent ad valorem duty rate. (3) &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of kitchen cabinets and vanities, as listed in Annex I to this proclamation, will be subject to a 25 percent ad valorem duty rate. &nbsp;This duty shall apply to completed kitchen cabinets and vanities as well as parts imported for use in kitchen cabinets and vanities. (4) Products tariffed pursuant to this proclamation shall not be subject to any tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended; Executive Order 14323 of July 30, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Brazil); or Executive Order 14329 of August 6, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation). (5) &nbsp;The rates of duty established in this proclamation shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 14, 2025. &nbsp;Effective January 1, 2026, the duty rate in clause 2 shall increase to 30 percent and the duty rate in clause 3 shall increase to 50 percent, and shall continue in effect, except for countries with which the United States reaches an agreement that addresses the threatened impairment of the national security posed by imports of wood products.&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, the tariffs imposed in this proclamation are in addition to any other duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported wood products. (6) &nbsp;If any wood product is subject to tariffs under both this proclamation and Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the wood product shall be subject to the terms and duties imposed pursuant to Proclamation 10908, as amended, and not those imposed pursuant to this proclamation.&nbsp; In addition, if any wood product is subject to tariffs pursuant to both this proclamation and the Executive Orders listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), as amended, the wood product shall be subject to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation, and not those imposed pursuant to the Executive Orders listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of Executive Order 14289, as amended. (7) &nbsp;Notwithstanding clauses 1 through 5 of this proclamation, the tariff imposed in this proclamation pursuant to section 232 that applies to imports of wood products from the United Kingdom shall not exceed 10 percent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding clauses 1 through 5 of this proclamation, the tariff imposed in this proclamation pursuant to section 232 that applies to imports of wood products from the European Union and Japan shall not result in a tariff that, when added to&nbsp;the applicable Column&nbsp;1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS, exceeds 15&nbsp;percent. (8) &nbsp;Any product described in clauses 1 through 3 of this proclamation, except those eligible for admission as &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as described in 19 C.F.R. 146.43 , that is subject to a duty imposed by this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation may only be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign&#8221; status as described in 19 C.F.R. 146.41 , and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rate of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. (9) &nbsp;The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of wood products and shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior executive branch official the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of imports of wood products with respect to the national security of the United States.&nbsp; The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the Secretary&#8217;s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232. &nbsp;By October 1, 2026, the Secretary shall provide the President with an update on imports of hardwood timber and lumber, their markets, and the domestic industry, so that the President may determine whether imposing an additional duty on imports of hardwood timber or lumber, such as the phased import duty recommended by the July&nbsp;1, 2025, report, as well as any additional duties on derivatives of such products, is warranted to address a threat to national security.&nbsp; The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the Secretary&#8217;s opinion, might indicate that the increase in duty rate provided for in this proclamation is no longer necessary.&nbsp; (10) &nbsp;The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary and any senior official the Trade Representative deems appropriate, shall pursue negotiations of agreements or continue current negotiations of agreements to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imported wood products from any country.&nbsp; The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, shall, from time to time, update me on the status or outcome of the negotiations described in this proclamation.&nbsp; At a minimum, the Trade Representative shall provide one such update before January 1, 2026, and a subsequent update no later than 180 days after the date of this proclamation. (11) &nbsp;The Secretary, in consultation with the&nbsp;United States International Trade Commission and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register .&nbsp; (12) &nbsp;Given the actions directed in this proclamation, and having considered the actions needed to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, I am directing that, effective for goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after 12:01 eastern daylight time on October 14, 2025, all tariff provisions under Chapter 44 of the HTSUS are hereby removed from Annex II of Executive Order 14257, as amended, except those tariff provisions that: &nbsp;(i) are included on the Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners Annex of Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements), and (ii) do not include products of a type that are subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order. (13) To the extent consistent with applicable law and the purpose of this proclamation, the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all actions that are appropriate to implement and effectuate this proclamation and any actions contemplated by this proclamation, including, consistent with applicable law, the issuance of regulations, rules, guidance, and procedures and the temporary suspension or amendment of regulations, within their respective jurisdictions, and to employ all powers granted to the President under section 232, as may be appropriate to implement and effectuate this proclamation. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, including 3 U.S.C. 301, redelegate any of these functions within their respective agencies. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures to implement and effectuate this proclamation. (14) Drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation.

On July 1, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products (collectively, wood products) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section 232). Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that wood products are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States and provided recommendations for action under section 232 to adjust the imports of wood products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. The Secretary found that present quantities and circumstances of wood product imports are weakening our economy, resulting in the persistent threats of closures of wood mills and disruptions of wood product supply chains, among other things, and diminishing the utilization of production capacity of our domestic wood industry. Because of the state of the United States wood industry, the United States may be unable to meet demands for wood products that are crucial to the national defense and critical infrastructure. Taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security and other relevant factors, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of the imports of wood products threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232. 3. In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary found that wood products serve as essential inputs across multiple sectors, supporting national defense, critical infrastructure, economic stability, and industrial resilience in the United States. 4. The Secretary found that wood products are used in critical functions of the Department of War, including building infrastructure for operational testing, housing and storage for personnel and materiel, transporting munitions, as an ingredient in munitions, and as a component in missile-defense systems and thermal-protection systems for nuclear-reentry vehicles. Further, the Secretary found that wood products support multiple critical infrastructure sectors of the United States, sectors that involve assets, systems, and networks considered so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on the national security, economic welfare, or national public health or safety of the United States. Wood products are particularly important to communications, energy, transportation, defense, and manufacturing, especially in supporting the United States power grid and transportation infrastructure. 5. The Secretary also found that while the United States possesses ample raw materials and industrial capacity to meet domestic wood products demand, wood production in the United States remains underdeveloped. At the same time, imports of wood products continue to rise, signaling foreign dependence and creating vulnerabilities in the domestic industry. Foreign subsidies and unfair trade practices are eroding the competitiveness of the United States wood products industry and disincentivizing investment and modernization. These circumstances have weakened domestic manufacturing capacity for wood products, and have increased reliance on foreign imports, weakening United States industrial resilience and placing national security and economic stability at risk. 6. The Secretary identified that these practices are threatening the United States wood products industry in a way that increases mill closures and weakens domestic capacity and employment across the United States. These closures and the attendant loss of jobs will raise costs and could inhibit the United States from fulfilling its national-security needs and demands for wood products. 7. In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a range of actions, including actions to adjust the imports of wood products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States . 8. After considering the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232 (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information, I concur with the Secretary’s finding that wood products are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In my judgment, and in light of the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232(d) (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information, I also determine that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt a plan of action that imposes tariffs, as described below, to adjust imports of wood products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 9. In my judgment, the actions in this proclamation will, among other things, strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create high-quality jobs, and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products such that the United States can fully satisfy domestic consumption while also creating economic benefits through increased exports. These actions will also encourage capital investment and drive innovation across the United States wood products industry, and strengthen the ability of the military and national-defense industry to domestically produce key munitions and defense systems and perform other required critical national-security functions. Modernization and renewed investment will curb further erosion of the United States wood industry and improve its efficiency, resource utilization, and product yield. These actions will adjust the imports of wood products and are necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of such articles. 10. To ensure the tariffs on wood products in this proclamation are not circumvented or that the purpose of this action to eliminate the threat to the national security of the United States by imports of wood products is not undermined, I deem it necessary and appropriate to establish processes to identify and impose tariffs on additional wood products, as further described below. 11. To ensure the effectiveness of the actions in this proclamation, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to address undervaluation, as further described below. In my judgment, when there is a threat of undervaluation, it may be appropriate for specific, compound, or mixed tariffs to be imposed. 12. Consistent with the General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (May 8, 2025), the United States intends to coordinate with the United Kingdom to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing the national security threat in the wood-products industry. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the framework agreements I have negotiated with the European Union and Japan, I intend to ensure that the tariff rate that applies to originating wood‑products of the European Union and Japan subject to this proclamation shall not exceed 15 percent. 13. Section 232 authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. Section 232 includes the authority to adopt and carry out a plan of action, with adjustments over time, to address the national-security threat. That initial plan of action may include negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners along with other actions to adjust imports to address the national security threat, including tariffs. If action under section 232 includes the negotiation of an agreement, such as one contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i), 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i), then section 232 also directs the President to take other actions he deems necessary to adjust imports and eliminate the threat that the imported article poses to national security if such an agreement is not entered into within 180 days of the date of this proclamation or is not being carried out or is ineffective, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A). 14. The Secretary and the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) have advised me that there are ongoing negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners that at least in part include discussions over wood products. In my judgment, and after considering the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the additional information provided to me by the Secretary and the Trade Representative, and other relevant factors and information, I have decided to include in my plan of action negotiations, with adjustments to tariffs depending on the status or outcome of such negotiations. I therefore direct the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, to pursue negotiation of agreements or continue current negotiations of agreements, such as agreements contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i), 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i), to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imported wood products. 15. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483 (section 604), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. ) (IEEPA), section 604, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of softwood timber and lumber, as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation, shall be subject to a 10 percent ad valorem duty rate. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of certain upholstered wooden products, as listed in Annex I to this proclamation, will be subject to a 25 percent ad valorem duty rate. (3) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of kitchen cabinets and vanities, as listed in Annex I to this proclamation, will be subject to a 25 percent ad valorem duty rate. This duty shall apply to completed kitchen cabinets and vanities as well as parts imported for use in kitchen cabinets and vanities. (4) Products tariffed pursuant to this proclamation shall not be subject to any tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended; Executive Order 14323 of July 30, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Brazil); or Executive Order 14329 of August 6, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation). (5) The rates of duty established in this proclamation shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 14, 2025. Effective January 1, 2026, the duty rate in clause 2 shall increase to 30 percent and the duty rate in clause 3 shall increase to 50 percent, and shall continue in effect, except for countries with which the United States reaches an agreement that addresses the threatened impairment of the national security posed by imports of wood products. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, the tariffs imposed in this proclamation are in addition to any other duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported wood products. (6) If any wood product is subject to tariffs under both this proclamation and Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the wood product shall be subject to the terms and duties imposed pursuant to Proclamation 10908, as amended, and not those imposed pursuant to this proclamation. In addition, if any wood product is subject to tariffs pursuant to both this proclamation and the Executive Orders listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), as amended, the wood product shall be subject to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation, and not those imposed pursuant to the Executive Orders listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of Executive Order 14289, as amended. (7) Notwithstanding clauses 1 through 5 of this proclamation, the tariff imposed in this proclamation pursuant to section 232 that applies to imports of wood products from the United Kingdom shall not exceed 10 percent. Notwithstanding clauses 1 through 5 of this proclamation, the tariff imposed in this proclamation pursuant to section 232 that applies to imports of wood products from the European Union and Japan shall not result in a tariff that, when added to the applicable Column 1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS, exceeds 15 percent. (8) Any product described in clauses 1 through 3 of this proclamation, except those eligible for admission as “domestic status” as described in 19 C.F.R. 146.43 , that is subject to a duty imposed by this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation may only be admitted as “privileged foreign” status as described in 19 C.F.R. 146.41 , and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rate of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. (9) The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of wood products and shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior executive branch official the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of imports of wood products with respect to the national security of the United States. The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232. By October 1, 2026, the Secretary shall provide the President with an update on imports of hardwood timber and lumber, their markets, and the domestic industry, so that the President may determine whether imposing an additional duty on imports of hardwood timber or lumber, such as the phased import duty recommended by the July 1, 2025, report, as well as any additional duties on derivatives of such products, is warranted to address a threat to national security. The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate that the increase in duty rate provided for in this proclamation is no longer necessary. (10) The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary and any senior official the Trade Representative deems appropriate, shall pursue negotiations of agreements or continue current negotiations of agreements to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imported wood products from any country. The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, shall, from time to time, update me on the status or outcome of the negotiations described in this proclamation. At a minimum, the Trade Representative shall provide one such update before January 1, 2026, and a subsequent update no later than 180 days after the date of this proclamation. (11) The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . (12) Given the actions directed in this proclamation, and having considered the actions needed to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, I am directing that, effective for goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after 12:01 eastern daylight time on October 14, 2025, all tariff provisions under Chapter 44 of the HTSUS are hereby removed from Annex II of Executive Order 14257, as amended, except those tariff provisions that: (i) are included on the Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners Annex of Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements), and (ii) do not include products of a type that are subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order. (13) To the extent consistent with applicable law and the purpose of this proclamation, the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all actions that are appropriate to implement and effectuate this proclamation and any actions contemplated by this proclamation, including, consistent with applicable law, the issuance of regulations, rules, guidance, and procedures and the temporary suspension or amendment of regulations, within their respective jurisdictions, and to employ all powers granted to the President under section 232, as may be appropriate to implement and effectuate this proclamation. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, including 3 U.S.C. 301, redelegate any of these functions within their respective agencies. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures to implement and effectuate this proclamation. (14) Drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (15) CBP may take any appropriate measure to administer the tariffs imposed by this proclamation. (16) The Secretary shall establish a process for including additional wood products within the scope of the tariffs described in this proclamation. The Secretary may add additional wood products within the scope of the tariffs described in this proclamation if, after considering the information from his monitoring of wood product imports with respect to the national security, any factor the Secretary deems appropriate, among other relevant information or considerations, the Secretary determines that inclusion of the additional wood product will reduce or eliminate the national security threat found in this proclamation and is consistent with the purpose of this proclamation. Appropriate factors include whether imports of the wood product have increased in a manner that threatens to impair the national security or otherwise undermines the objectives set forth in this proclamation. The process the Secretary establishes may include receiving requests or information from domestic producers of wood products or other interested entities or individuals. (17) The Secretary shall establish a process for determining whether there is a threat of undervaluation of wood product imports subject to tariffs pursuant to this proclamation. If the Secretary finds that there is a risk of undervaluation of any particular class of imports of wood products subject to tariffs imposed pursuant to this proclamation, the Secretary is authorized to impose specific, compound, or mixed tariffs at a rate that he determines to correspond approximately to the ad valorem duty rate otherwise in effect under section 232 for the same class of articles through notice in the Federal Register . (18) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. If any provision of this proclamation or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

This National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate the unmatched might of America&#8217;s industrial base &#8212; and we acknowledge the enduring truth that no nation can rival the strength of the American workforce when we manufacture products at home. To restore America&#8217;s industrial power, in my first 100 days in office, I secured more than $5 trillion in new private and foreign investments in the United States, creating more than 450,000 new jobs and setting the stage for a new era of American manufacturing dominance. These commitments prove that innovation surges, factories expand, opportunities multiply, and capital flows back into our Nation when we promote production on our shores. By placing reciprocal tariffs on foreign nations whose trade policies threaten our economy, we are protecting American manufacturing from the unfair practices that have hollowed out our manufacturing base in past decades. My tariff policy is reminding the world that America&#8217;s trade policy must serve the American people first, strengthen American industries, and ensure that no other country prospers at America&#8217;s expense. Already, my Administration has brought in billions of dollars in tariff revenue &#8212; and in the years ahead, that revenue will be invested in communities from coast to coast, securing lasting benefits for the American people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we are eliminating burdensome regulations that stifle innovation and growth.&nbsp; After 4 years of decline and stagnation, we are cutting red tape, rejecting the failures of the Green New Scam agenda, and pursuing bold reforms that save taxpayers billions of dollars every year.&nbsp; These actions are sparking growth, unleashing innovation, creating jobs, and empowering American enterprise to build and expand.&nbsp; Through the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year, we enacted 100 percent immediate expensing for new factories and industrial improvements, making the United States the investment capital of the world and ensuring that expansion remains the hallmark of American manufacturing for decades to come. &nbsp;And through a whole-of-government approach to workforce development, my Administration is also harnessing artificial intelligence to accelerate productivity, revitalize manufacturing, create new industries, and ensure no American workers are left behind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This National Manufacturing Day, we affirm that the strength of our Republic rests on the strength of our industries and the determination of our workers.&nbsp; Under my leadership, we&nbsp;are protecting domestic production, enforcing fair trade, driving new investment into our homeland, and securing lasting prosperity for our people by ensuring that America remains the world&#8217;s leading industrial power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

As my Administration works to prevent wildfires, we encourage every family to take measures to avert the risks and damages caused by household fire &#8212; including by having a fire escape plan, testing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms on a monthly basis, and identifying potential hazards like unattended cooking, faulty wiring, or overheated appliances.

Purpose . The United States faces an urgent and growing threat in the Arctic region posed by strategic competition, aggressive military posturing, and economic encroachment by foreign adversaries. These actions undermine United States sovereignty; jeopardize critical shipping lanes; and threaten energy, mineral, and national defense interests. The United States Coast Guard&#8217;s fleet of icebreakers and Arctic-capable vessels remains insufficient to meet current operational demands and presents a national security risk. Sec . 2 . Restriction on Construction of Vessels in Foreign Shipyards . (a) Pursuant to 14 U.S.C. 1151(b) and 10 U.S.C. 8679(b), I find that it is in the national security interest of the United States to construct up to four Arctic Security Cutters (ASCs) abroad. Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the United States Coast Guard, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, informed by the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, shall submit to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a plan to phase the construction of ASCs in a manner that promotes the on-shoring of expertise necessary to build follow-on icebreakers domestically. (b) &nbsp;This memorandum shall not preclude continued investment in the United States industrial base or future domestic construction of ASCs. &nbsp;Rather, it is a time-limited measure to bridge a critical capability gap. (c)&nbsp; The Director of OMB shall transmit this memorandum to the Congress consistent with 14 U.S.C. 1151(b) and 10 U.S.C. 8679(b)(2). Sec . 3 . Termination and Sunset Clause . This authorization shall terminate 4 years from the date of this memorandum unless extended by the President or terminated earlier through appropriate Presidential action. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

On August 3, 1492, following years of intense study, preparation, and petitioning, Christopher Columbus secured funding from the Spanish Crown to set out on a daring expedition that most believed to be impossible. Commissioned by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, Columbus and his crew boarded three small ships &#8212; the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria &#8212; to set sail on a perilous voyage across the Atlantic. He was guided by a noble mission: to discover a new trade route to Asia, bring glory to Spain, and spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to distant lands. Just over 2 months later, on October 12, 1492, Columbus made landfall in the modern-day Bahamas. Upon his arrival, he planted a majestic cross in a mighty act of devotion, dedicating the land to God and setting in motion America&#8217;s proud birthright of faith. Though he initially believed he had arrived in Asia, his discovery opened the vast frontier and untold splendors of the New World to Europe. He later ventured onward to Cuba and other islands in the Caribbean &#8212; exploring their coasts and engaging with their people. Guided by steadfast prayer and unwavering fortitude and resolve, Columbus&#8217;s journey carried thousands of years of wisdom, philosophy, reason, and culture across the Atlantic into the Americas &#8212; paving the way for the ultimate triumph of Western civilization less than three centuries later on July 4, 1776. Outrageously, in recent years, Christopher Columbus has been a prime target of a vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage. Before our very eyes, left-wing radicals toppled his statues, vandalized his monuments, tarnished his character, and sought to exile him from our public spaces. Under my leadership, those days are finally over &#8212; and our Nation will now abide by a simple truth: Christopher Columbus was a true American hero, and every citizen is eternally indebted to his relentless determination. As we celebrate his legacy, we also acknowledge the contributions of the countless Italian-Americans who, like him, have endlessly contributed to our culture and our way of life. To this day, the United States and Italy share a special bond rooted in the timeless values of faith, family, and freedom. My Administration looks forward to strengthening our long and storied friendship in the years to come. This Columbus Day, more than 500 years since Columbus arrived in the New World, we follow his example, we echo his resolve, and we offer our gratitude for his life of valor and grit. Above all, we commit to restoring a Nation that once again dares to tame the unknown, honors our rich cultural inheritance, and offers rightful praise to our Creator above. In commemoration of Christopher Columbus&#8217;s historic voyage, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as &#8220;Columbus Day.&#8221; NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

According to tradition, Leif Erikson&#8217;s zeal for adventure began as a young man in Greenland, where he heard stories of distant lands across the sea. Determined to chart those waters himself, and guided by his deep Christian faith, he assembled a brave crew and set sail, voyaging more than 1,800 miles across the Atlantic Ocean through brutal winds and storms. With courage in his veins and faith in his God, Erikson realized his purpose when he reached the shores of a land he called &#8220;Vinland,&#8221; known today as L&#8217;Anse aux Meadows at the northern tip of Newfoundland, Canada. With this incredible discovery, Leif Erikson became the first European to land in North America and cemented his place as one of the great explorers in world history. He returned home a hero, bringing with him the exciting news of uncivilized lands. His achievement inspired countless explorers to venture into North America, and ultimately paved the way for the first American settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, more than 600 years later. Leif Erikson&#8217;s triumphant spirit of exploration has continued to define the American story &#8212; from the pioneers who tamed the Western frontier to the Apollo 11 astronauts who proudly planted the Stars and Stripes on the Moon. His legacy lives on through the millions of Americans who proudly share in his Nordic ancestry. These patriots have embodied the same character of courage and resolve, and have immensely enriched our history, our culture, and our communities. My Administration continues to strengthen our bonds with the proud Nordic nations from which Erikson came. Together, with our allies in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland, we are advancing fair trade and promoting peace through strength &#8212; ensuring a safer and more prosperous future for America and the North Atlantic. As we celebrate the heroic life of the great Leif Erikson, we embrace his legacy, recognize the contributions of the millions of Nordic Americans, and recommit to advancing the timeless drive of discovery that has always stood at the heart of America&#8217;s destiny. To honor Leif Erikson, son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, and to celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as &#8220;Leif Erikson Day.&#8221; NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . My Administration is committed to driving innovation to prevent and treat childhood diseases, including through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death for children in the United States aged 1-19 years, and its incidence has increased by more than 40 percent since 1975. As outlined in my joint address to the Congress in March, reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission established in Executive Order 14212 of February 13, 2025 (Establishing the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission). &nbsp;AI presents an opportunity to more quickly achieve this aim. In 2019, my Administration created the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), a Federal investment in childhood cancer research of $50&nbsp;million in funding every year for 10 years to address the critical need to collect, generate, and analyze childhood cancer data. &nbsp;The CCDI is building a foundational data infrastructure, aggregating and generating new data, and using this data to make new discoveries. AI can be used to build upon this data initiative to produce meaningful solutions to pediatric, adolescent, and young adulthood cancer. &nbsp;This application of AI has the potential to transform the Nation&#8217;s current care and research approach for pediatric cancer -– as well as our healthcare and research infrastructure more broadly –- through use of the rich and multimodal data, secured with appropriate individual privacy protections, to develop early and superior diagnostics, identify cures and optimize treatments, and advance medicine that will save lives. For too long, we have watched our children and their families battle cancer and its long-term chronic effects while healthcare systems often rely on outdated technologies and can be slow to adopt certain innovations.&nbsp; We must prioritize investment in AI-enabled science, build world-class scientific datasets, and empower researchers and clinicians with the tools needed to translate data and AI capabilities into improved care. &nbsp; Sec . 2 . Harnessing American AI Innovation . The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and in alignment with the implementation of America&#8217;s AI Action Plan, shall work to develop innovative ways to utilize advanced technologies such as AI to unlock improved diagnoses, treatments, cures, and prevention strategies for pediatric cancer. The initial focus shall be on identifying opportunities to accelerate the progress of AI-driven solutions at the CCDI, including by making data platforms and tools available as part of the CCDI Data Ecosystem and funding research projects at National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that prioritize: (a)&nbsp; improving data infrastructure by consolidating data from multiple sources for AI-ready analysis and utilizing AI to better select participants for clinical trials; (b)&nbsp; enhancing data analysis of complex biologic systems with AI tools to radically improve predictive modeling of patient response, disease progression, and treatment toxicity and to turn multi-omics data and imaging data into novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers; and (c)&nbsp; improving clinical trial design, access, and outcomes for patients by incorporating multimodal data and using AI approaches to maximize utilization of the information from clinical trials and improve accessibility, recruitment, administration, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trial results. Sec . 3 . Increasing Investment and Engagement in Pediatric Cancer Research and Care Infrastructure . The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the APST, shall prioritize expanding pediatric cancer research and advancements in care by identifying and implementing strategies for: (a)&nbsp; increasing investment from existing Federal funds for the CCDI and other Federal Government initiatives that address pediatric cancer; and (b)&nbsp; encouraging the private sector to make use of the most advanced technologies to unlock cures for pediatric cancer, including those based on AI, to the maximum possible extent. Sec . 4 . Improving Data Sharing and Empowering Patients . The Secretary, in consultation with the APST, shall work to ensure that AI innovation is appropriately integrated into current work on interoperability to maximize the potential for electronic health record and claims data to inform private sector and academic research and clinical trial design, while ensuring that patients and parents control their health information. In addition, the Secretary shall work to finalize interoperability standards for patient data to be used with AI that appropriately account for structured and unstructured data and enable safe and privacy-compliant exchanges of data. Sec . 5 . Definition . For the purposes of this order, &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; or &#8220;AI&#8221; has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3). Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Health and Human Services. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

This application of AI has the potential to transform the Nation’s current care and research approach for pediatric cancer -– as well as our healthcare and research infrastructure more broadly –- through use of the rich and multimodal data, secured with appropriate individual privacy protections, to develop early and superior diagnostics, identify cures and optimize treatments, and advance medicine that will save lives. For too long, we have watched our children and their families battle cancer and its long-term chronic effects while healthcare systems often rely on outdated technologies and can be slow to adopt certain innovations. We must prioritize investment in AI-enabled science, build world-class scientific datasets, and empower researchers and clinicians with the tools needed to translate data and AI capabilities into improved care. Sec . 2 . Harnessing American AI Innovation . The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and in alignment with the implementation of America’s AI Action Plan, shall work to develop innovative ways to utilize advanced technologies such as AI to unlock improved diagnoses, treatments, cures, and prevention strategies for pediatric cancer. The initial focus shall be on identifying opportunities to accelerate the progress of AI-driven solutions at the CCDI, including by making data platforms and tools available as part of the CCDI Data Ecosystem and funding research projects at National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that prioritize: (a) improving data infrastructure by consolidating data from multiple sources for AI-ready analysis and utilizing AI to better select participants for clinical trials; (b) enhancing data analysis of complex biologic systems with AI tools to radically improve predictive modeling of patient response, disease progression, and treatment toxicity and to turn multi-omics data and imaging data into novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers; and (c) improving clinical trial design, access, and outcomes for patients by incorporating multimodal data and using AI approaches to maximize utilization of the information from clinical trials and improve accessibility, recruitment, administration, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trial results. Sec . 3 . Increasing Investment and Engagement in Pediatric Cancer Research and Care Infrastructure . The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the APST, shall prioritize expanding pediatric cancer research and advancements in care by identifying and implementing strategies for: (a) increasing investment from existing Federal funds for the CCDI and other Federal Government initiatives that address pediatric cancer; and (b) encouraging the private sector to make use of the most advanced technologies to unlock cures for pediatric cancer, including those based on AI, to the maximum possible extent. Sec . 4 . Improving Data Sharing and Empowering Patients . The Secretary, in consultation with the APST, shall work to ensure that AI innovation is appropriately integrated into current work on interoperability to maximize the potential for electronic health record and claims data to inform private sector and academic research and clinical trial design, while ensuring that patients and parents control their health information. In addition, the Secretary shall work to finalize interoperability standards for patient data to be used with AI that appropriately account for structured and unstructured data and enable safe and privacy-compliant exchanges of data. Sec . 5 . Definition . For the purposes of this order, “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3). Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Health and Human Services. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 30, 2025.
